Meta just reported earnings. The stock
is up 6 and a half% in the after hours.
Absolutely absolutely amazing report.
They pretty much crushed it. Massive
beaten earnings per share 8.88 versus
823 expected. They also beat on revenue.
Now what's really surprising to me in
the report is Meta is still growing 24%
revenues and they're expected to grow
30% in revenues in Q1 of 2026. I don't
know many companies over a trillion
dollar in market cap. They're still
growing 24% in revenues, not in earnings
per share in revenues organically. And
it really tells you that the capex that
Mark Zuckerberg is spending right now in
2026. It has nothing to do with the
metaverse hype and the metaverse dream
that he was spending on and he wasted
all this money back in 2021. This is
actually driving organic growth. It's
driving revenue growth. It's driving
efficiency and I'm going to talk about
this a little bit more and I was talking
about it in my videos many times and
that's why I started a position in Meta
and I've been buying the dips on the
stock and I thank Mr. Market for the
opportunities and rationality in
general. Earnings per share was 8.88. It
was their highest earnings per share uh
quarter ever. The company is still
growing in daily active people. Over 3.6
billion people use the app every single
day. And I always talk about how this is
extremely underrated and it goes under
the radar within the company because the
company has access to 3.6 billion
people. Meta can decide to launch an app
tomorrow or a website or a actually a
decent AI product like something as good
as Gemini or Chat GPT and they don't
have to spend any money on advertising.
They own the advertising bridge you
could say. They're like a toll bridge
for advertising and they can reach 3.6
billion people overnight. the reach and
this should be worth much more than 22
times earnings or 20 or 21 times
earnings. Yet this is where MEA is
trading at. And to me it's absolutely
absolutely uh ridiculous. Now for their
capex it was you know also ridiculous
115 to 135 billion for 2026 which is
double what they spent back in 2025. And
many people were surprised that why did
Meta guide for such for 135 and the
stock went up? People were expecting for
Meta to go down on such high capex
guidance. But there's a reason for that.
And the main reason for that is the
market is starting to realize that this
capex again it has nothing to do with
the metaverse mansion in the metaverse
and buying land online or whatever that
is and some some crazy things. This is
actually helping them. They're finding
efficiencies. they're making money from
it. And this they said it themselves.
They said we've seen a 30% increase in
output per engineer with the majority of
that growth coming from the adoption of
agentic coding and also seeing more
efficiencies in other areas. They're
also helping their ad business and they
we talked about this before they made
like 60 billion from ads related to AI.
How AI is helping them and they're using
AI to help uh to create like agents that
help businesses when they advertise.
they could ask them questions and they
pretty much help them in general. So
this is to me is absolutely crazy. And
there's another reason why the stock is
up and this is Reality Labs. Reality
Labs has been a money- losing business
for many years and it keeps losing more
and more money every single quarter and
every single year. But this is what Mark
Zuckerberg said. He said, "I expect
Reality Labs losses this year to be
similar to last year, and this will
likely be the peak as we start to
gradually reduce our losses going
forward while continuing to execute on
our vision." And that gives the market a
lot more certainty because they were
expecting the reality of the ABS
business to be a mind- losing business
forever and losses to keep are
increasing. Well, now it's speaking and
losses are about to be reduced over the
next few years. Uh the CEO is even
laying off more than 8,000 reality lab
employees and they're trying to focus
more on VR and wearable devices such as
the Meta Rayban smart glasses which have
been a massive massive success. Now I
just told you about a company that's
likely going to be leading in AI. AI is
helping them fight the efficiencies.
They own WhatsApp, they own Instagram,
they own Facebook, they own Oculus, they
own the meta smart glasses which is
doing really really well. They have
access to 3.6 6 billion people every
single day is a growing 24% and 30% in
quarterly revenues. Where do you believe
the stock is trading at? I would say 30
times earnings. 28 29 times while MEA is
trading at 23 times earnings. Despite
the recent rally, it's still trading at
only 23 times earnings. And this is
extremely undervalued relative to other
stocks where Microsoft is still at 28
times, Apple 31, Google 31, Amazon,
which I own is at 32 and ABGO is at 35
times earnings. Now the reason why Meta
trades at a lower multiple is because
99% of the revenues is advertising. But
the CEO mentioned that over the next few
years, the company is exploring new
products that will allow them to
diversify away from advertising. And if
they can successfully scale those other
products, maybe it's a cloud business,
maybe it's some kind of an other
subscriptionbased business that could
provide the company a massive multiple
expansion because a company with the
reach that Meta has, it should be
trading much more than 23 and 24, maybe
27 or 28 or potentially 30 times
earnings. But there's also a call option
that's not really priced within Meta.
And this is Meta potentially being
number two or even number three or even
number four at least on this chart of
the generative AI traffic share. If you
look at this chart, you see Chad GPT,
you see Gemini expanding, you see
DeepSync, and you don't really see Meta
pretty much at all. And reason for that
is Meta has a terrible product. They
have 3.6 billion people, but they have a
terrible product. And they're going to
be launching more and more AI products
over the next few months going into
2026. So if Meta actually has a good
product and this product is within
WhatsApp, within Instagram, within
Facebook, most people they spend time on
WhatsApp chatting with their friends. If
Meta has a good chatbot, why would they
need to exit WhatsApp to go to chat GPT
or Gemini and then go back to WhatsApp?
If they could just do it while they're
chatting on WhatsApp, why would they do
it? Why would they have to exit
Instagram to go to chat GPT if they
could do the AI stuff on Instagram and
edit the picture and post it right right
away on Instagram or maybe something
related to Facebook or maybe something
within the meta smart glasses. So Meta
has the potential to be a leader in
terms of an AI traffic share, but
they're not even number two. They're not
even number three or number four on the
chart. And I believe that could be a
call option on the company that could
happen in 2026. and it's definitely not
priced in the stock at 22 or 23 times
earnings. I still believe Meta is worth
over $1,000 per share. I still see more
than an 18 20% annual return. I think
earnings per share after 2026 should
grow about 18 to 20% in line with
revenue growth as margins should pick
up. So it's pretty much trading at about
one times almost 1.1 1.2 two times PEG
ratio or price to earnings growth and I
think we should get an a a return pretty
close to the earnings per share growth
of 18 to 20%. So that's my opinion on
meta. Hope you enjoyed it. It was not
financial advice. If you did enjoy it,
please press the like button and maybe
consider subscribing. So, I'll talk to
you in another

## 4) Prompt Used (From Config)
### 4.1 System Prompt
```text
Du bist ein Analyst für Investing (Aktien, Makro, Krypto).

OUTPUT-FORMAT:
- Gib STRICT JSON aus: genau EIN JSON-Objekt, keine Prosa, keine Codefences.
- Keine externen Fakten. Kein Web-Fact-Checking. Nur das, was im Transcript steht.

TASK: stocks_per_video_extract

ZIEL:
- Pro Transcript extrahierst du:
  (A) echte Aktien-Deep-Dives → `stocks_covered`
  (B) Makro- & Crypto-Insights → `macro_insights` (mit sauberen `tags`)
  (C) substanzielle, aber nicht Deep-Dive Aktien-Segmente → `stocks_mentioned`
  (D) sonstige relevante Learnings/Prozess/Risiko/Portfolio → `other_insights`
  (E) wörtlich belegte Zahlen/Valuation/Levels/Guidance → `numbers`
- Keine “Name-Drops” ohne Substanz.

SCOPE / OUTPUT-POLICY:
- `stocks_covered`: NUR wenn Deep-Dive.
  Deep-Dive-Kriterium:
  * mindestens 2 Evidence-Items
  * davon mindestens 1× role="thesis"
  * plus mindestens 1× role in {"risk","catalyst","numbers_valuation","comparison"}

- `stocks_mentioned`: Für Aktien, die inhaltlich besprochen werden (Setup/Valuation/News/Levels),
  aber die Deep-Dive-Kriterien nicht erfüllen.

- Alles, was primär BTC/ETH/Altcoins/Onchain/Derivatives/Stablecoins/Regulation ist,
  kommt NICHT in `stocks_covered`, sondern in `macro_insights` mit Crypto-Tags.

- Alles Wichtige, das weder Makro/Crypto noch eindeutig einer Aktie zuzuordnen ist,
  DARF NICHT verloren gehen → in `other_insights` ablegen.

TAG-TAXONOMIE (für `macro_insights.tags`):
- Makro:
  ["macro","rates"] | ["macro","inflation"] | ["macro","liquidity"] | ["macro","credit"] |
  ["macro","usd"] | ["macro","commodities"] | ["macro","growth"] | ["macro","sentiment"] |
  ["macro","policy"] | ["macro","recession"] | ["macro","soft-landing"]
- Crypto:
  ["crypto","btc"] | ["crypto","eth"] | ["crypto","alts"] | ["crypto","stablecoins"] |
  ["crypto","onchain"] | ["crypto","derivatives"] | ["crypto","regulation"] |
  ["crypto","mining"] | ["crypto","cefi"] | ["crypto","defi"] | ["crypto","rwa"]

EVIDENCE-REGELN (kritisch):
- Jede Evidence `quote` muss wörtlich im Transcript stehen (verbatim).
- Nutze den kürzesten zusammenhängenden Ausschnitt, der den Claim belegt.
- Keine erfundenen Zahlen/Details.
- Wenn der Channel-Host spekuliert: formuliere `claim` als "Channel-Host meint/behauptet …"
  und senke `confidence`.
- `snippet_sha256` ist die Hash des Snippets (wie im Input erwartet), nicht erfinden.

EVIDENCE-ROLLEN (für `evidence[].role`):
- "thesis"            = Bull-These / Kernargument pro/contra (nur das Hauptargument)
- "risk"              = Bear-Argument, Risiko, Gegenargument, auch Kill-Switch als Formulierung "Kill-Switch: …"
- "catalyst"          = Auslöser/Katalysator, Event, Zeitfenster (wenn genannt)
- "numbers_valuation" = Zahlen/Valuation/Multiple/Guidance/Levels (nur wenn wörtlich belegt)
- "comparison"        = Peer-Vergleich, Alternatives, Relativbewertung
- "other"             = falls nichts passt (sparsam)

TRANSCRIPT-QUALITÄT:
- grade="ok": gut lesbar, kohärent
- grade="low": viele Lücken/ASR-Fehler, unvollständig
- grade="unknown": nicht beurteilbar

COVERAGE-ZIELE (gegen „3–4 Sätze“):
- Wenn transcript_quality.grade == "ok" und das Transcript inhaltlich reich ist:
  * insgesamt >= 6 Items kombiniert aus (`macro_insights` + `other_insights`)
  * wenn es Aktiensegmente gibt: >= 1 Item in (`stocks_covered` ODER `stocks_mentioned`)
  * wenn Zahlen/Multiples/Levels vorkommen: `numbers` befüllen (so viele wie sinnvoll, ohne Duplikate)
- Wenn grade == "low": weniger Items ok, aber nichts Wichtiges droppen; dann eher `other_insights` nutzen.

Regeln (kurz):
- Keine Name-Drops ohne Substanz.
- `stocks_covered` nur bei Deep-Dive (siehe System-Regeln).
- Wenn Aktie relevant, aber kein Deep-Dive → `stocks_mentioned`.
- Makro+Crypto in `macro_insights` mit sauberer Tag-Taxonomie.
- Alles sonst Wichtige → `other_insights` (niemals droppen).
- Zahlen/Multiples/Levels/Guidance (nur wörtlich) → `numbers`.
- Jede Evidence `quote` muss wörtlich im Transcript vorkommen.
- Nutze `transcript_path` und `raw_hash` exakt wie im Input-Block.

Anzahl Transkripte: {transcript_count}

{transcripts}
```

## 5) Why the Summary Feels Thin
Observed gaps vs transcript richness:
- Multiple **valuation comparisons** are mentioned (Meta 22–23x vs MSFT/Apple/Google/Amazon/AVGO) but not captured in `numbers`.
- **Growth guidance** is stronger than shown: 30% revenue growth expected in Q1 2026 is not captured.
- **Reality Labs** discussion includes loss stabilization, layoffs (8,000) and shift to VR/wearables — only lightly reflected.
- **AI traffic-share “call option”** and product distribution moat (WhatsApp/IG/FB) are not represented as separate insights.
- **Return expectations** (18–20% annual return, EPS growth 18–20%, PEG 1.1–1.2) are missing from `numbers`.

The current summary meets minimum policy (1 stock covered + a few numbers), but not the implied coverage depth for a rich transcript.

## 6) Recommendations for Prompt Engineering
Concrete changes to improve coverage and depth:

1) **Enforce numbers completeness**
   - Add rule: if any valuation multiples or peer comparisons appear, they must be added to `numbers` (context: `multiple`).
   - Add rule: include *all* explicitly stated numeric comparisons (e.g., MSFT 28x, Apple 31x, Google 31x, Amazon 32x, AVGO 35x).

2) **Split multi-topic insights**
   - Add a requirement: each distinct thesis block becomes a separate `other_insights` item.
   - Example blocks: AI efficiency (agentic coding + output/engineer), Reality Labs loss peak + layoffs, distribution moat, AI product gap/traffic share.

3) **Capture forward-looking claims**
   - Add explicit instruction: when host makes forward-looking return/growth claims, place them in `numbers` or `other_insights` with low confidence and “host claims…” phrasing.

4) **Increase minimum counts on rich transcripts**
   - Current coverage targets are generic. For `transcript_quality=ok` and length > N chars, require:
     - `numbers` >= 8 items
     - `other_insights` >= 4 items
     - `stocks_covered` >= 1 (already)

5) **Force evidence anchoring**
   - Add a soft rule: each numbers item must have a direct quote (shortest possible) and a max snippet length to reduce fluff.

6) **Add a “valuation comparison” bucket**
   - Either a dedicated `numbers.context=multiple_comparison` or a separate `other_insights` item for comparative valuation and reason for discount.

## 7) Candidate Output Expansion (Example Targets)
(For guidance only; not a regenerated summary)
- Numbers: EPS 8.88 vs 8.23 expected; revenue growth 24%; Q1 2026 revenue growth 30%; capex 115–135B; 3.6B DAU; AI ad revenue 60B; Meta 23x; MSFT 28x; Apple 31x; Google 31x; Amazon 32x; AVGO 35x; PEG 1.1–1.2; expected annual return 18–20%; EPS growth 18–20%.
- Other insights: AI efficiency uplift (30% output/engineer), Reality Labs losses peak + layoffs, distribution moat via WA/IG/FB, AI traffic share “call option”, market acceptance of capex pivot.

## 8) Additional Notes
- Transcript has ASR errors (e.g., “823 expected” vs “8.23 expected”). The prompt should allow minor ASR normalization with low confidence when context is clear, but still quote verbatim evidence.
