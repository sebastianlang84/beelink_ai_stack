# agents/README

Purpose: Catalog for agent-governance and continuity documents.
Primary repo navigation still starts at `INDEX.md`.

## Scope
- Agent process and policy decisions: `agents/adr/`
- Episodic continuity logs: `agents/memory/daily/`
- Agent/meta methods and prompt engineering notes: `agents/plans/`

## Root Main Docs
- `AGENTS.md` - normative agent/process rules (highest priority)
- `MEMORY.md` - current snapshot + long-term memory
- `INDEX.md` - root navigation
- `README.md` - operator guide

## Boundary to docs/
- `docs/` remains for service/operations documentation:
  - `docs/runbooks/`
  - `docs/policies/`
  - `docs/plans/` (service/project plans)
  - `docs/adr/` (service/architecture decisions)
