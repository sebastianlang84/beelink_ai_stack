# Stocks: Hims & Hers (HIMS) Investment Thesis

## Executive Summary
- HIMS is positioned as a top buy for February 2026 following a 60%+ share price drop.
- The company is disrupting the $400B pharmaceutical industry by operating entirely outside the traditional insurance ecosystem.
- Key growth drivers include advanced lab testing, AI integration, and upcoming 2026 peptide product launches.
- Valuation is considered highly attractive at 3.3x EV/Sales compared to high-growth peers.

## Key Points
- HIMS avoids the overhead of insurance to offer lower consumer prices ("They are living outside of the insurance ecosystem because it brings in a whole bunch of overhead and costs").
- The business model focuses on direct-to-consumer compounded GLP-1s and oral medications without membership fees, unlike competitor Ro.
- Recent infrastructure investments include a $1B capital raise for AI and supplier acquisitions.
- The company is now profitable and sustainable with improving operating margins.
- Future growth relies on becoming a "healthcare ecosystem" using lab data, wearable integration (Garmin), and medical record tracking.

## Numbers
- metric: Share Price Drop | value: 60 | unit: % | context: Recent pullback from peaks
- metric: Market Cap | value: 6.8 | unit: billion USD | context: Current valuation
- metric: EV/Sales | value: 3.3 | unit: ratio | context: Compared to PLTR (88x) and TSLA (17x)
- metric: Revenue Growth (3-yr) | value: 71 | unit: % | context: Historical compound growth

## Opportunities
- **Peptide Launch:** Expected in 2026 following the 2025 acquisition of a peptide manufacturing facility.
- **Lab Testing:** Advanced lab testing (100+ biomarkers) creates a "baseline" for long-term customer retention and personalized care.
- **Multiple Expansion:** Potential for the EV/Sales ratio to re-rate higher as the company proves its disruptive model.

## Risks
- **Growth Deceleration:** Quarterly growth slowed to 50% recently; tough comparables expected in Q1 2026 due to previous GLP-1 shortages.
- **Market Sentiment:** The stock has been a "detriment" to portfolios over the past few months due to heavy selling.

## Unknowns
- Specific peptide products to be launched in 2026 are currently undisclosed.
- Long-term impact of pharmaceutical company opposition to the HIMS model.

## IST-Stand
HIMS is currently a profitable, high-growth telehealth company trading at a significant discount to historical highs and tech peers. It is transitioning from a product-specific seller (ED, Hair Loss) to a comprehensive health ecosystem provider.
