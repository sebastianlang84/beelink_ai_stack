# Stocks: Wall Street Sell-off in Fintech and Growth

## Executive Summary
- The transcript describes a broad "dumping" of future-oriented finance and growth stocks by Wall Street.
- Modern brokerages (Robinhood, eToro, Bull) are seeing significant sell-offs despite gaining market share from legacy institutions.
- PayPal (PYPL) experienced a 20% drop following the firing of CEO Alex Chris.
- The speaker views the current market as irrational, favoring "potato chips" (defensive/staples) over technology and chips.

## Key Points
- **Brokerage Shift**: Younger investors are moving capital to Robinhood, Weeble, and Coinbase rather than Wells Fargo or JP Morgan ( "They're using Robin Hood... They're not going to use Wells Fargo brokerage").
- **SoFi Performance**: Despite a strong Q4, the stock is down and trading at what the speaker considers a "buyable" level.
- **Robinhood (HOOD) Valuation**: The stock fell under 0.5 on the speaker's internal spreadsheet metric, entering a "buyable" category after a 10% drop.
- **Circle (CRCL) Growth**: Circle is reported to be down 66% in private/secondary markets despite USDC circulation growing 108% year-over-year.
- **PayPal (PYPL) Leadership**: CEO Alex Chris was fired; the speaker notes a 6% growth rate is too low for growth investors but potentially attractive for value investors at $41.
- **Hims & Hers (HIMS)**: Mentioned as a "punching bag" for the market, experiencing consecutive days of heavy selling (5%, 2%, 10% drops).

## Numbers
- metric: PayPal Stock Drop | value: 20 | unit: % | context: Decline following CEO termination
- metric: Circle (USDC) Circulation Growth | value: 108 | unit: % | context: Year-over-year growth
- metric: PayPal Growth Rate | value: 6 | unit: % | context: Top-line growth deemed insufficient for "growth snobs"
- metric: Robinhood Buy Level | value: 0.47 | unit: score/ratio | context: Speaker's internal "buyable" threshold (under 0.5)

## Opportunities
- **Fintech Value**: PayPal at $41 is cited as interesting for value investors, specifically regarding their stablecoin and BNPL efforts.
- **Market Share Capture**: Modern platforms (HOOD, ETOR, BULL) are successfully taking capital from legacy institutions.

## Risks
- **Short-termism**: Wall Street is focused on the next quarter or Fed chair rather than long-term fundamentals.
- **CEO Instability**: Rapid leadership changes (PayPal) reacting to stock price rather than strategy.

## Unknowns
- The identity of the new PayPal CEO and their future strategy.
- The specific "criminal investigation" mentioned as a market headwind.

## IST-Stand
The market is currently rotating out of high-growth fintech and semiconductors (Nvidia) into defensive sectors, creating what the speaker identifies as deep value in "future of finance" stocks.

# Crypto: Bitcoin, Stablecoins, and the Gold Disruption Narrative

## Executive Summary
- Bitcoin is trading in the low $75,000 range amidst a broader market sell-off.
- MicroStrategy (MSTR) continues to outperform Bitcoin despite the price drop.
- Stablecoins (USDC) are positioned as the primary disruptors of legacy payment networks like Visa and Mastercard.
- A long-term thesis suggests Bitcoin is superior to gold due to the future threat of asteroid mining increasing gold supply.

## Key Points
- **Bitcoin Price Action**: BTC is currently in the low $75k range; the speaker views the "bear" period as a time for study.
- **MSTR Resilience**: MicroStrategy is falling in line with Bitcoin but "should be" falling 50% more based on typical volatility, indicating relative strength.
- **Gold vs. Bitcoin**: Gold's scarcity is challenged by the prospect of SpaceX and asteroid mining (e.g., the "golden asteroid" near Mars).
- **Coinbase Strategy**: The speaker highlights Coinbase's "Base" Layer 2 and their partnership with Circle as key strengths.
- **Solana (SOL)**: Mentioned as "firing on all cylinders" despite being sold off with the broader market.

## Numbers
- metric: Bitcoin Price | value: 75,000 | unit: USD | context: Current trading level during recording
- metric: Asteroid Gold Concentration | value: 10 | unit: ppm | context: Compared to 0.00001 ppm on Earth
- metric: Golden Asteroid Value | value: 700 | unit: quintillion | context: Potential gold supply that could devalue the asset

## Opportunities
- **Stablecoin Disruption**: Stablecoins are viewed as the technology that will replace "horses" (legacy banks/Visa/Mastercard).
- **Base Layer 2**: Coinbase's move into Ethereum Layer 2 (Base) is noted as a significant ecosystem development.

## Risks
- **Regulatory/Legal Noise**: Mention of a "criminal investigation" causing market jitters, though the speaker dismisses its long-term relevance.
- **Gold Supply Inflation**: Long-term risk to gold holders from space-based mining technology (SpaceX).

## Unknowns
- The specific details of the criminal investigation mentioned in the transcript.
- The timeline for NASA's 2029 missions and their impact on commodity markets.

## IST-Stand
Bitcoin and high-performance alts like Solana are being sold off due to short-term macro fears, while the speaker maintains a conviction that fiat is "going to zero" and crypto is the only viable successor over gold.
