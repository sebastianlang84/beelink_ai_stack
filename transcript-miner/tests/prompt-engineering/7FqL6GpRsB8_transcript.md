Over the past three months, SoFi shares
are down 27% and this is despite the
fact they reported phenomenal results
for the fourth quarter. I want to dig
through those results and go through
exactly what they're expecting for 2026
because as a shareholder in SoFi, the
company is doing absolutely everything
that I expect. They continue to grow the
topline, continue to add more members.
They're adding more products and
services and they're moving into
disruptive spaces like the blockchain
and how that technology is going to
potentially disrupt a lot of the finance
industry. SoFi is really well positioned
for that in the future, but the market
is not really giving them credit for
that right now. So, I'm going to dig
through exactly what we learned. My name
is Travis Ham. Thanks for watching

they'll give you their top 10 stocks to
buy right now. I want to start here with
some of the valuation metrics because
this kind of gives a baseline of where
SoFi is sitting today. It's not the
cheapest stock on the market and it
definitely could go lower, but I think
we are getting to pretty good value
territory about a $29 billion market
cap. Priced earnings multiple on a
trailing basis is 59 on a forward basis
is 50. That seems really high, but they
are investing in new products and
growing the business. Price to book is
often times something that investors
look at when they're looking at banking
stocks. I don't know if it's necessarily
the best metric for a company like SoFi
because this is much more of a digital
company. There's more leverage in that,
but that is 2.8. 8 right now priced to
free cash flow on a forward basis maybe
a little bit better metric 36 but all
that should be put into context that
this is a very very fast growing company
this is not a company that's growing at
the rate of a typical bank where you
maybe grow single digits maybe into
double digits a little bit SoFi is
growing much much faster than that at
just a really high level net revenue a
billion dollars up 37% year-over-year
adjusted IBITA up 37 or up 31% to $318
million. And net income, this company is
now net income positive, 17% gap margin
and $174 million net income, earnings of
13 cents per share. All these things
beat estimates. One of the things that I
keep watching with SoFi is this number
right here, the feebased revenue. So
SoFi is looking at the entire banking
ecosystem a little bit different than a
lot of traditional banks. And with a
traditional bank, you would go in and
say, "Hey, I want to take out a $10,000
loan." They'd say, "Okay, a personal
loan. and we're going to give you that
for 10% 15%. They may not even give you
that loan, but that would all sit on
their balance sheet. What So is doing is
originating those these loans at scale
with their technology platform and then
they're selling those loans to other
investors. So those investors are
actually opening up liquidity for parts
of the market, particularly personal
loans, where there just wasn't a big
market in the past. That's where SoFi
has gotten a lot of their growth from.
Same thing with student loans. And now I
think we're going to see more
traditional loan growth of things like
mortgages and things like that long
term. But that doesn't necessarily have
to be on SoFi's balance sheet. So you
want to see high growth in this fee
based revenue because there's
essentially no risk in that. The risk
then is put on those investors who are
buying the yield from those loans. So
just gets to keep the fees and this is
for operating their platform. If you're
not familiar with all the products that
they have, they have an increasing suite
of products, uh, banking, credit cards,
investing. Credit cards is one of the
things that when when I talk about their
financing growth, their financial
services growth. This is where a lot of
this comes from because there are swipe
fees. So, they're going to generate
continuous wet revenue, but that's also
going to make customers a little bit
more sticky. They're going to be going
to SoFi for their credit card. May maybe
I'll move my banking over there as well.
Maybe I'll even move my investing loans
and then cryptocurrencies. Thanks to our

So they showed this every quarter the
number of members. This is thousands of
members that they have and members
basically just a user of their platform.
40.1% compound annual growth rate. Just
a phenomenal growth rate. I also own
shares of Robin Hood. The one criticism
of Robin Hood, they don't have the same
member growth that you have with a
company like SoFi. So, both phenomenal
companies, both growing really quickly,
but I love this member growth. And then
products is just basically how many
things are each one of those members
using. Are they using banking? Are they
using a credit card? So, if you're using
both of those things, that would be two
products. So, 20.2
million products out right now. So, that
means the average user is still using a
little less than two products. But as we
look at the growth, you can see the big
thing that you want to look at is
adjusted net income. This is the
operating leverage that you want to see
in the business. adjusted growth and
adjusted EBIDA. That's going to be a
good proxy for how much cash flow
they're coming they're getting from the
business. But net income is going to
pull out all your expenses, all your
taxes. And this is where you really want
to see that operating leverage kicking
in. That's exactly what we've seen over
the past five. And the big growth driver
over the past couple years has been
financial services. So 88% net in
revenue growth year-over-year for this
segment. Just phenomenal revenue growth.
A lot of that is interest income
primarily generated from deposits and
credit card loans. But then there's not
non-interest income as well. So that's
the top half right here. And that's
going to be feebased revenue generated
from the loan platform business. So if
they're giving out a loan and they're
selling it, they don't actually have
that in the lending business. That
revenue comes into this financial
services segment. This is interchange
fees. The interchange fees are going to
be the fees you get from credit cards,
referrals, brokerage, all of those kinds
of things. And again like you see with
the business overall phenomenal
operating leverage in the business the
contribution profit now 51%.
And finally when you look at their
results I think this is the other thing
that stuck out to me is the stock is
dropping right now but their guidance is
just phenomenal. Most banks would love
to report expectations for 30% growth
year-over-year in 2026. Adjusted EBA
expected to grow 52%
net income 72% diluted earnings per
share up to 60 cents. That would be a
54% increase. This is the kind of
momentum that you want to see in any
company that you own. And the difficult
thing about buying asymmetric stocks is
you don't necessarily know when they're
going to go up or when they're going to
go down. But if you buy companies that
are able to compound their revenue, have
operating leverage in the business, and
you're buying it for a reasonable price
over a long period of time, those are
likely going to be huge winners in the
portfolio. That's why I have SoFi in my
portfolio. That's why I'm getting more
interested in buying more right now. I'm
not quite there. I'm not quite at the
point where I would back up the truck
with a stock stock like SoFi. But if if
we start to see it go under $20 per
share, even under something like $15 per
share, that would be a phenomenal buying
opportunity, I think, for SoFi. But let
me know what you think of the quarter in
the comments section below. Don't forget
