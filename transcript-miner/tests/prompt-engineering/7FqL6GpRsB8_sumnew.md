# Stocks: SoFi Q4 Results and 2026 Outlook

## Executive Summary
- SoFi shares are down 27% over the last three months despite beating Q4 estimates.
- The company has achieved GAAP net income profitability with a 17% margin.
- Growth is driven by a 40.1% CAGR in members and significant operating leverage in the Financial Services segment.
- 2026 guidance projects 30% revenue growth and a 72% increase in net income.

## Key Points
- SoFi is transitioning to a capital-light model by originating loans and selling them to investors rather than holding all risk on-balance sheet ("selling those loans to other investors").
- Member growth is a primary differentiator compared to competitors like Robin Hood ("they don't have the same member growth that you have with a company like SoFi").
- The Financial Services segment saw 88% year-over-year net revenue growth, driven by interest income and interchange fees.
- The average member currently uses slightly less than two products, suggesting room for internal cross-selling ("average user is still using a little less than two products").
- Management is guiding for 2026 diluted EPS of $0.60, representing a 54% increase.

## Numbers
- metric: Market Cap | value: 29 | unit: billion USD | context: Current valuation baseline
- metric: Revenue Growth | value: 37 | unit: % | context: Year-over-year net revenue increase
- metric: Net Income | value: 174 | unit: million USD | context: Q4 GAAP net income
- metric: Member Growth | value: 40.1 | unit: % | context: Compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
- metric: Forward P/E | value: 50 | unit: multiple | context: Based on current growth investments
- metric: Price to Book | value: 2.8 | unit: ratio | context: Valuation metric for the digital banking platform

## Opportunities
- High-margin fee-based revenue growth reduces balance sheet risk while maintaining platform scale.
- Expansion into traditional loan products like mortgages provides a long-term growth runway.
- Significant operating leverage: Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow 52% in 2026, outpacing revenue growth.

## Risks
- Valuation remains high relative to traditional banks (P/E of 59 trailing, 50 forward).
- Market sentiment remains decoupled from fundamental performance ("market is not really giving them credit for that right now").

## Unknowns
- The specific timing of when the market will re-rate the stock to reflect its growth.
- The exact impact of future blockchain technology integration on the existing finance stack.

## IST-Stand
SoFi is currently net income positive with accelerating member and product growth. Despite a 27% recent share price decline, the business is demonstrating strong operating leverage and has issued aggressive growth guidance for 2026.
