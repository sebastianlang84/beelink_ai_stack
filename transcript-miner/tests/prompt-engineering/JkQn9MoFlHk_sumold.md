## Summary
The portfolios of four investment legends (Buffett, Pelosi, Aman, and Gates) show high divergence in selection but consensus on three specific technology pillars. Over a five-year period, these disparate strategies yielded drastically different results, ranging from doubling an initial investment to more than sextupling it. Despite having a 97% non-overlap rate, the "smartest investors on Earth" converge on Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple as core infrastructure holdings.

## Key Points & Insights
- **Low Portfolio Overlap:** Out of 120+ combined holdings, the four legends share only three stocks, representing a ~2.5% overlap rate. ("97% of their portfolios don't even touch one another.")
- **Three Shared Pillars:** The consensus holdings among the legends are Alphabet (search), Amazon (cloud/logistics), and Apple (consumer brand/engine).
- **Consensus on Infrastructure:** Amazon's AWS logistics and consumer scale are viewed as "infrastructure right now and they're not optional bets."
- **Indirect Positioning:** While some legends hold shares directly, others like Bill Gates maintain exposure through large indirect positions (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway).
- **Strategy Variance:** The speaker highlights that "four completely different futures" exist based on which legend's style an investor follows, as demonstrated by the wide range in historical returns.

## Numbers
- **$10,000 to $65,000:** The growth of the top-performing legendary portfolio over a 5-year period.
- **$19,000:** The value of a middle-performing legendary portfolio after 5 years from a $10,000 start.
- **120+:** The total number of combined holdings across the four featured portfolios.
- **2.5%:** The overlap rate between the portfolios.
- **30%:** The approximate size of Bill Gates' position in Berkshire Hathaway, providing indirect Apple exposure.

## Chances
- **High performance correlates with tech concentration:** The top-performing portfolios align on specific tech pillars regardless of the investor's style.

## Risks
- **Strategy Underperformance:** One of the highlighted legendary portfolios "barely even doubles their money" over five years, significantly lagging behind the $65,000 result.
- **Diversification Gap:** Because 97% of holdings are unique to each legend, following only one specific style carries high idiosyncratic risk compared to the consensus group.

## Unknowns
- The specific identity of which investor achieved the $65,000 return versus the one who barely doubled their money.
- The names of the other 117+ holdings that do not overlap.
- The specific style or strategy "Aman" represents in the comparison.
- The exact timeframe referenced as "right now" for the current holdings vs. the "5 years ago" backtest.
