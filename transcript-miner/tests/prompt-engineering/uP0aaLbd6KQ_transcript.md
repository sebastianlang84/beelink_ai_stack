Holy smokes, this ain't no dang jokers.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the first
A++ income statement in the history of
me grading income statements here today
with Palunteer. I had to do it. Oh my
gosh, these results were just shocking.
The guidance was insane. Crazy to think
this stock was almost in the Goolog just
a few years ago, right? I have shares I
bought at $7.35, $743. The Goolog is $5
and under, right? It was so dang close.
Fascinating how things can switch,
right? I posted this inside my private
stock group's Discord chat. In the
Palunteer chat, I said, "Arg arguments
can be made about Palunteer's valuation,
future growth rates, and where the stock
will go. No arguments can be made
against Palanteer having some of the
greatest financial statements in the
world. Absolutely incredible. We'll talk
about Palanteer in this video, what my
expectations are for not only the
company, but the stock moving forward,
those sorts of things. is somebody
that's been an investor for many years
now at this point in time. We're also
going to talk about the market in this
video. 23 hours ago, I posted this on my
X page. If you ever want to follow me on
X, I always have it linked in the
description area down there. I said,
quote, "The largest stock market crash
in history will be tomorrow. I'm seeing
many posting this on X today. I call BS.
I would gladly welcome it." Obviously,
it did not happen, right? 440,000 people
ended up getting to see that post. And
here was the results of this devastating
day we were supposed to have. Public
count was up $20,000 plus dollars here
today. I posted this 22 or posted this
about 58 minutes ago. 22,000 people have
gotten to see it so far. Like it's just
fascinating, right? We're going to talk
about the stock market, where the stock
market's headed from here. All that good
stuff in this video here today. Okay.
Then after we get done going through
Palanteer and where the market's headed
from here, we're going to wrap. We're
going to get into three videos here.
Okay. One is Tom Lee went on CNBC spoke
about his opinion on price action, where
things are headed from here. He spoke
just a few hours ago on CNBC. Then I
want to react to this one from 10 hours
ago. Bitcoin could plunge to 40,000. Oh
my gosh, that's almost cut in half from
where we're at right now. So, I thought
that one would be an interesting one to
react to and especially how that
correlates with other risk assets. When
you see things like Bitcoin, Ethereum,
if we're talking about 50% more downside
or at least 40%, right? uh that can have
major correlations with a lot of growth
stocks and so I want to speak about like
how that correlates with the market in
those sorts of stocks in general. And
then Dan Niles, Nvidia clearly thinks a
lot differently of OpenAI than they once
did. This is in response to Jensen very
recently kind of being interviewed and
really kind of sounding like, oh yeah,
we're not really that excited to invest
in OpenAI. That was the gist of what
came out of that. So I want to hear Dan
Niles his opinion on stocks, the market,
all that good stuff in today's video.
One thing, one thing I only need from
you guys. If you could please just smash
a little like button, that's all I need
from you. I hope you appreciate me
covering all this stuff for you guys.
Trying to keep you in the loop on all
this good stuff. Uh, that's all I need
from you. If you want to be subscribed
here to the channel, you can certainly
subscribe. It's free to do so. I think
we're at 120. We're probably at close to
127,000 subscribers now on the channel.
So, I appreciate each and every one of
you for being here. Okay. So, Palanteer,
first and foremost, listen,
these results were unbelievably great.
Like, the beats were insane. Uh, revenue
came in a 70% growth. 70%
growth in revenue, right? Meanwhile,
cost to revenue was only up 24%. So,
gross profit was up 83%. Gross profit
was just under$1.2 billion billion
dollars from 652.
It's insane. Meanwhile, sales and
marketing was hardly even up for the
company year-over-year. It was up like
$14 million. That's like nothing, right?
R&D brought it down. GNA brought it
down. Total operating expenses were down
year-over-year. How can you grow revenue
70%.
And have your operating expenses go
down?
What?
Like, that's one of those things. How's
that even literally possible? It'd be
one thing if it were up slightly, but
down. What? That's insane. Income from
operations $575 million versus $11
million in the same quarter last year.
Uh interest income was also up for the
company $62 million from 54 mil. That's
despite interest as far as like you know
if you're buying like government bonds,
T bills, things like that. It's yielding
less than it did a year ago or certainly
two years ago, right? But Palanteer so
much more in it now because they produce
so much cash that you know essentially
they're able to generate even more from
it. other expense was up slightly for
the company year-over-year up about $2
million, but income before income tax is
621 mil from $80 million. Uh, man, they,
you know, they're in a very favorable
tax spot right now, probably because of,
my guess is, losses in past years is
maybe helping them out. Net income $611
million from $76 million the same
quarter last year. Uh, EPS on a diluted
basis, 24 cents versus 3 cents. I, you
know, I felt bad if I just graded an A+,
which is usually my top grade. It was
such a ridiculously
great report that I'm like, I've got to
give this an A++. Like, it's like if
your student, you know, turned in an
essay and the essay was like so much
better than a normal A+, right? You just
feel like, oh, I feel bad for only
grading this an A+. Like, I need like a
higher grade. Like, this is
unbelievable, right? That's how I felt
in regards to this. The the rule of 40
for Palanteer is at some shocking number
like oh gosh, what was it? 127 or
something like that, right? Operating
margin uh with revenue growth. Like it's
just ridiculous. So now with Palunteer,
let's speak a moment. The the guidance
was insane. They're guiding for like
somewhere around roughly just under $7.2
billion of revenue for the full year.
That's way ahead of what Wall Street was
expecting. I mean, we're talking this is
almost a billion dollars ahead of what
Wall Street expects. Okay. Now, okay.
So, we spoke about the great news. The
cash flow is insane. The balance sheets
insane. The income statement is insane.
The growth rates are insane. The
guidance is insane. Boom. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Boom. Karp's operating on a
incredible incredible wavelength. Right.
Okay. We spoke about the good. Let me be
the Debbie Downer cuz somebody's got to
do it. some like I feel like no one can
be like the guy that will give you the
real about all the great stuff and also
the real about the stuff that hey here
here's where it can go bad right it's
either people either got to be one side
or the other I'm the one dude the one
dude that can tell you how it is from
both sides so I've told you the great
and the great and the great and the
great now let me be the Debbie Downer
listen okay very important
they're going to have to comp these
ridiculous 2026 numbers, okay, that
they're about to put up. We're talking,
you know, obviously the growth rates
went insane in 2025. Now, they're going
to obviously go to another level in
2026, and they're going to have to comp
these numbers in 2027. The comps are
going to be absolutely brutal.
I would say there's like a 95%
probability percentage growth rates
start to go down in 2027.
inconsiderably. They'll probably start
at some point this year, but definitely
in 2027. Okay. Now, for those of you
that might be new to the market, you're
like, "What does that mean?" That means
if you're a company, let's say you're
growing revenue of 70%, it goes down to
like 40%. Or 30%. Or something like
that. Okay? It doesn't mean you stop
growing. It means the percentage
increase. And I think that's very
important. I say that cuz I know
sometime, you know, some people watch my
videos, you've been in the market for
years, you know exactly what I'm saying.
Some people have been in the market for
a few months and they, you know, have no
clue what they're talking about and
they're like, "Oh, you're saying the
company's revenue is going to go down."
No, no. Like, like, you know, like I
wish sometimes people like learn all
this stuff first and then worry about
commenting, right? I think that' be
important. But, um, that's what's going
to happen. And so what that means for
the stock, so listen, this stock could
be up 20, 30, 40%. Right now after
hours, if people were confident 2027 was
going to be another acceleration year,
they're not. And that's why you're not
seeing the stock react the way you would
think the stock would react given they
just reported one of the most insane
income statements you've ever seen in
your life, right? Some of the most
insane growth rates you've ever seen
from a SASish related company, right?
The guidance is ridiculous. The other
thing is they're they guided for such a
high number this year that the Beats,
although they could still come in and
beat and maybe they come in at 7.3 or
7.4 billion or maybe even 7.5, the Beats
are going to be tough to like shock and
awe throughout the year now because they
took that bar up so high. If they really
wanted to play the game of Wall Street a
little bit better, they should have
guided for like $6.6 billion of revenue,
right? Uh, keep in mind the street was
at like 6.1 6.2. I think they were at
6.2 the street was at. So 6.6 would have
still been like insane. It would still
been like $400 million ahead of where
the street was at roughly, right? But
what could have happened is they could
have still came in and shock and odded
throughout the year, right? And still
came in with a 7.2 7.3 or 7.4 billion
fullear number. Now shock and awe very
low probability, right? So when you also
tack on the the fact that the
valuation's insanely rich, right? You
know, that's where we run into trouble
with Palanteer. And so that's why
Palanteer, if you're wondering about the
stock price, right? Where does Palanteer
stock price go from here? As I've
stated, you know, for really like the
past year, Palunteer stock price is
stuck. It's going to be stuck between
125 and right around that $200ish dollar
level, right? And it will just go up, go
down. People are feeling really bullish
about Palanteer. It'll go up to that
200ish level range, right? People are
feeling bearish around Palanteer will go
down to about 125 and it's just going to
be stuck there for years. That's what I
see. Even though Palunteer is going to
keep coming in and absolutely putting up
great numbers, right? Cuz let's think
about it. Palanteer has these insane
growth rates in 2026. Let's say growth
rates go down to 40%. Right? Or 30%.
Which still be great numbers in um you
know 2027, right? Let's say 35%
midpoint. That's still an amazing
number. How many companies in the SASish
related space are growing like that?
Very few, right? So, those would still
be great numbers. But when you're used
to revenue growing at 70% clips or
something like that and all a sudden you
go down to 35 40, that's where people
started saying gh. And that this is what
I explained a long time ago to people.
You know, if you've been watching my,
you know, channel for a while, I've been
explaining this is the issue. Palanteer
growth rates are about to peak in terms
of percentage increase. They're going to
keep growing revenue for years to go in
the future, but in terms of percentage,
the rate of increase, they're about to
peak, right? And start going down. And
so you go from like 70% growth to maybe
like, you know, 68% growth down to 60%
growth, 50, right? And then um you know,
it's just like that's natural for
companies. Nvidia is a good example of
that. When Nvidia's growth rates were
just going higher and higher and higher
and higher in terms of percentage,
right, the stock was going insane, it
ran huge. It ran all the way to 200
plus. And then once Nvidia started
showing, okay, the growth rates are
really starting to decelerate. That's
when Nvidia stock started to, you know,
basically be stuck. And that's exactly
what we've seen with Nvidia, right?
Nvidia stock was 200, if I recall,
Nvidia stock was 200 plus. Like what was
that last summer? I think it was early
last summer. Nvidia stock was like 200
plus. And now you look at Nvidia, it's
like, I don't know, $180 something
dollars a share, right? And guess what?
Numbers have been incredible at Nvidia.
They kept reporting great banger
numbers, kept growing the business huge.
It's just the stock ran ahead of it,
right? And so that's what happens in the
stock market. Stocks run ahead of the
numbers a lot of times. And you know it
does outlandish moves just as Palanteer
shouldn't have like Palanteer shouldn't
have been $200 plus dollars last year.
Just like Palunteer should not have been
$7 in 2022. The stock market just moves
too extreme. retail investors,
especially new retail investors, people
in their first few years of being in the
market, get very frustrated because they
look and they're like, "How is this
company reporting such amazing numbers,
such amazing growth rates, but the
stock's not really reflecting like a new
all-time high, a new all-time high, and
it's like you got to understand like
stuff is priced in, you know, a year in
the future, 6 months in the future,
sometimes several years in the future,
right?" Um, so those are just all
factors to kind of keep in mind in
regards to Palanteer. So you have a
company that is almost as perfect as
perfect gets in regards to income
statement, balance sheet, cash flow. I
mean, the CEOs carp's doing an amazing
job. The whole team's doing an amazing
job, but you just have a stock that's
just stuck in the mud, right? And I
think it's going to remain like that for
years. And you know, that'll be that.
The the good news is for people that
maybe want to build a huge position,
right? you're probably going to have a
few years to build it in kind of the 125
to 200 range, right? So, and also I
could be wrong like maybe Palanteer just
keeps growing at 70 and 80% growth rates
and like you know for years to go in the
future. I don't think that's realistic
at all at all.
But let's say they kept doing that for
years. Let's just say for the next three
four years they keep growing at 70 80%
growth rates. Then the stock won't get
stuck, right? Then we're going with $300
$400 stock, right? But I would put the
odds on that extremely low probability
that the company keeps growing for the
next three or four years at 70 and 80%
growth rates. I'd put that at like a 5%
probability.
5% probability. Right? So, and last
thing I'll say about Palunteer before we
move on the market in general, because a
lot of people like to try to come in and
short the stock. Listen, listen, listen.
Okay? I got to be honest with you guys.
This is not a great stock to short or to
bet against.
The reason being is the financials are
so insanely strong.
It's brutally tough to bet against this
stock. Okay, a much easier bet. Much
easier bet. If you want to talk about
two companies that trade huge
valuations, a way easier bet is Tesla.
Why? Because Tesla doesn't have the
financials to back up its valuation.
Palanteer has these incredible financial
statements, a ridiculous income
statement that's an AA plus grade, a
balance sheet that's a one of one,
right? Incredible cash flow. Tesla
doesn't have that. Tesla's cash flow
statement is weak. The income statement
is weak. That's not an opinion. That is
a fact.
When you look at Tesla trading at a $
1.5 trillion market cap or whatever it
is, the income statement is incredibly
weak and the cash flow is incredibly
weak. balance sheets strong but still
not like strong like you know compared
to their peers which are other big tech
companies right that actually probably
have the weakest balance sheet of all
the stocks that are in that kind of like
mag seven space so if you're going to
like if you're going to bet against
either Tesla or Palanteer because you
want to hedge you know against market
downside way easier way easier to hedge
against Tesla because you don't have
these ridiculous growth rates you got a
company that's like you trying to do
this magic thing and that that magic
thing. Their whole whole core business
is just in shambles right now. They want
to get out of certain like Tesla's a
whole mess, man. Palanteer is not a
mess. Palanteer is greatness. There's a
big difference. Okay. And so I I don't
even like it when people compare
Palunteer and Tesla at this point in
time. Tesla doesn't deserve to be in the
same sentence as Palanteer factually.
Like Palunteer is reporting A++ grade
income statements. Tesla's not. Okay.
There's a big difference between like a
stock that is go has gone up a lot
because they deserve to versus like a
hype situation like a Tesla. Right now,
next up here, let's talk about the
market. Right? Typical, you know, market
scatterbrain activity I was seeing on X
yesterday. Oh, the largest market crash
ever is coming tomorrow. It's going to
be a blood bath out there, right? And
all this stuff, you know, and I'm like,
I called BS on all this. Like, you guys
are just going crazy. Uh people assume
that because Bitcoin and Ethereum were
tanking over the weekend that that's
going to magically bring down the whole
stock market, right? Uh
listen, okay? And and obviously people
were already worried because of what
silver did back on Friday and all these
sorts of things, right? And what did I
explain to you guys in I think it was a
video I recorded yesterday on this
channel, right? What did I explain to
you guys? I said, "This is going to have
little to no ramifications on the
overall stock market. It could maybe
bleed into some stocks that maybe people
leverage into, but that's about it." I
said, "If you're thinking about this is
going to take down the whole stock
market and have the whole stock market
crash because silver just, you know, had
its second biggest drop ever and because
Bitcoin, Ethereum are tanking, guess
again." Okay, guess again. Like, this
isn't going to tank the whole market.
It's not like, you know, somebody that's
leveraged into Bitcoin or Ethereum or
silver is like super leveraged for the
S&P 500 or something like that that
would tank the whole market. No, it
doesn't work like that. Okay? So,
ramifications are small if at all.
Right? And um that just is what it is,
man. It can have some ramifications for
risk assets, but other than that, it's a
sleepy situation. Now, as far as where
the stock market goes from here, okay,
now let's talk about where the stock
market goes from here. Listen,
two companies are going to completely
dictate where the stock market heads
from here. And they both report earnings
this week. One is AMD and one is Amazon.
Okay? These are the most important
stocks by a mile. By a mile that are
going to be reporting this week and
really dictating where the stock market
goes. AMD is so important because this
is a risk-on stock. uh a lot of retail
investors are invested into it. It's a
big position for me. You have over a
million dollars in AMD stock, right?
It's huge from a psychological
perspective, also from a spending
perspective. AMD's results, if they're
really great and that guidance is really
great, it can move Nvidia, it can move
NU, it could move SanDisk, it can move a
lot of stocks, okay, a lot of stocks.
Also, the from the psychological
perspective around like riskon type
stocks because you think about AMD,
that's like a riskon type stock, right?
And so AMD is so vital, so vital for the
stock market, right? Not the biggest
market cap. So from a market cap waiting
perspective on what it means for the S&P
500 and Q's, that's not what it's about.
It's about the psychology side of
things, right? If AMD doesn't, you know,
come in with great numbers and that
stock goes down, it's going to put a
it's going to put a damper on the whole
market, right? I I think the numbers are
going to be great. I think the guidance
is going to be great. I think the
commentary is going to be great. and up
and away we go. But we'll see. We'll see
in regards to that. Right. The second
stock that's the big market mover for
how this market's going to go from here
is Amazon. Amazon is vital and
specifically Amazon has to come through
where where Microsoft missed, right?
Microsoft did not put up the incredible
Azure growth that everybody was
expecting, right? So now Amazon has to
come in and save the market by showing
great growth in AWS. They have to show
another reaceleration. Last quarter they
accelerated the AWS growth to I think it
was around 20% if I recall from like
17%. We got to take it to another level
now, right? We got to take it to like 22
24 25%. If he can do that, the market's
saved in regards to momentum coming back
into certain mag 7s and specifically
Amazon because that will show people
like, okay, people are making money from
AI. Meta was able to show that in a
great way, right? Meta's growth rates
are insane. The guidance was super
strong. People are like, whoa, Meta is
actually making money from AI, right?
They're spending all this money, but at
least they're getting something out of
it. AWS spent a lot of money. We know
that, right? Amazon spent a lot of
money, but we got to see the growth rate
start to come in. So, people want to see
a 22 a 25% growth rate for AWS. They can
do that momentum back on Amazon's side.
The e-commerce business, you know,
obviously a shareholder like myself
that's a big shareholder of the company,
I'll be looking at those heavily, but
that's not the thing that will move the
stock. Earnings per share, I'll be
looking at that heavy. profitability.
I'll be looking at that heavy as a big
investor. But that's not what the market
that's not what really would give Amazon
momentum and the whole market momentum.
It really really comes down to AWS.
Okay. And so Microsoft let everybody
down. Uh you know, they basically came
in line or slightly under expectations
when it came to Azure growth. AWS got to
do it, man. Got to do it. They get it
done. Come in, you know, several
percentage points over what Wall
Street's expecting. Get ready. Rocket
ship ride, baby. Rocket ship ride. The
momentum will be back. Okay. Okay. Now,
we're going to go ahead and react to
some videos here. And uh before we get

it's really for individuals if you're
somebody out there that got over
$100,000 net worth. Okay? All righty.
Let's get into this.
>> Lee Funstrat, uh, head of research. I'm
not going to say that u that that you
didn't call this Tom because it was the
beginning of the year you were uh
talking about
did did you use the word uh speed bumps
or volatility or I don't know what it
was but you also said that it
>> what
it could be based on things coming out
of Washington that the
>> uh sir in all due respect are we paying
attention to Tom Lee's predictions
because I mean like Tom Lee had some
pretty outlandish predictions on where
Bitcoin, Ethereum was going to end last
year, where it was going to end in
January. None of these things have even
remotely come close to true. Like
they're dramatically off. So like I mean
all due respect like Tom Lee's coming up
with some some misses lately and quite a
few misses, right? And so you know I
don't know maybe he only pays attention
to certain things.
>> Mark is going to be held hostage of that
to some extent. Is is this worse than
you expected or pretty much uh what you
were thinking?
>> Um well and parts of it have been much
worse like you know how I I think the
crypto market has taken it much worse
than we expected. Um
>> why I think part of it is that crypto
industry doesn't have any leverage right
now. It sort of delevered in October and
now when we have gold and silver doing
so well especially at the start of the
year that created FOMO and that was like
a vortex sucking all risk appetite
towards the precious metals trade. So I
think crypto has suffered from that on a
price basis at a time when the
fundamentals have been good. You know
it's it's been a contrast. I think the
broader economies actually
>> the the fundamentals have been good.
The fundamentals have been good for
Bitcoin and Ethereum. What fundamentals?
In all due respect, Tom Lee, what
fundamentals are we talking about
>> shape? So to me, the turmoil here is
kind of what
>> this is not AMD. This is not Amazon.
This is not Palanteer. This is not meta.
There's no there's no fundamentals, sir.
In all due respect,
>> there's a lot of uncertainty because of
Washington picking winners and losers.
And some of this could be the new Fed
pick. Um, but I but I'm also kind of
heartened. I think gold and silver
taking a breather is actually a good
thing.
>> A breather. I mean, 80 on silver that it
isn't really that's not breathing yet.
Uh, it's it's like I don't know what
that is. Um,
you you you do point out that the
consensus now is for the the GOP to lose
the house and that is not necessarily a
negative for the markets for the future
because it's already consensus. Yeah, I
think it's consensus. Uh it might
actually be a positive surprise if the
GOP keeps the house. Um
>> if that were to happen,
>> if that were to happen, but that's a big
if. I think one of the things that we're
seeing, of course, this year is uh the
White House is is deliberately picking
more winners and losers early. I think
because of the midterms, in other words,
they're alleged.
I think that has caused some turmoil in
markets. Even if it was Hasset or I
don't know I don't know who would the
markets would have liked but you think
no matter who it is that the market
tests the new Fed the new chairman of
the Fed when he's announced or she is
announced.
>> We saw that with uh Fed Chair Yellen and
Fed Chair Powell that in the early days
the market tests them whether it's their
resolve around policy or rates. So I
think the confirmation process creates a
little uncertainty and then I think the
first FOMC meeting. So it I think that's
why the middle of the year could be
quite bumpy.
>> You um then you point out some things
maybe to to get keep everyone a little
bit grounded. Stocks were up the first
five days of this year. Stocks were up
1% in January of this year since 1950.
Um that's happened about half a little
bit less 36 times. That's 76 years. And
the S&P was up 18% on average after a
start like that. But I thought you said
it. Someone recently said they don't
even pay attention. I was David Bond.
They don't even pay attention to what
happens in January. That that indicator
doesn't work. It's like the Super Bowl
indicator. It's had its heads time. And
>> you think it does historically? This is
important here.
>> Yeah, it's very telling. I mean, there's
36 times when it happened just exactly
as you described.
>> 33 to 36 times the market was up. The
average gains 18%. If you look at the
non 36 instances, the other 34 or so,
the market on average is down 5% for the
year. So it makes a huge difference to
do well in the first week in the first
month. A lot of this uh obviously
you know the giveth and taketh away AI
went almost not like gold and silver but
kind of I mean asthotic and a lot of
those starts trillions of dollars of
valuation. So that's going to be tough.
That could be a headwind. Is that just
you know regresses or do we use regret
mean regression or reverse?
>> Yeah, mean reverts. Yeah.
>> Which do you like better reverse?
>> You know I could use I could see both
working.
>> I know. I know. Uh all right. So that
that could be a problem. What? And
so crypto didn't doesn't have leverage
right now. Is it going to go to the
levels that you have talked about in the
past still or let's say 75,000 for
Bitcoin? Is that a place where people
would say, "Okay, I'm ready to buy." Or
is 40,000 a place where people say, "I'm
ready to buy."
>> Okay. I'm going to say something that
does it sounds a little contrarian, but
Tom Demar is our adviser at Bitine in
terms of crypto. Mhm.
>> He's been since mid mid November saying
Bitcoin would go to 77 and Ethereum at
2400.
So he's been waiting for what what he
calls time and price to align. This
weekend he believes we reach that
alignment. So he he all the pieces are
in place for crypto to be bottoming
right now cuz we're getting the level
and enough time has passed. So I think
as long as crypto fundamentals are good,
which is the case, you know, Ethereum
active addresses is going parabolic
right now and activity. Part of it is,
of course, Wall Street is building up
digital assets and converging the those
businesses. If that's the case, then
crypto prices should follow.
>> So as far as bottom goes,
you know, uh how would I say this?
throwing darts at a dart board. Anybody
anybody want to throw darts at a dart
board? Like that that's what we're
playing in regards to this game of like,
oh yeah, we bottomed uh
like, you know, you could easily make a
case that there's no signs of a bottom
in Bitcoin or Ethereum right now, right?
You look at the Bitcoin cycle, it says
we're, you know, Bitcoin, Ethereum is
going to continue to go down. You know,
we'll have some bounces here and there,
but the overall trend is down all the
way until we get a Q4 bottom of this
year, right? and the bottom is you know
we're talking another 50% plus downside
between now and that actual bottom. Um,
so you know, something to kind of keep
in mind here. And thing with Tom Lee,
like I remember 2022, you know, Tim Tom
Lee kept kind of like trying to take the
bullish side. And obviously the market
kept working against him, right? And by
the end of 2022, basically everybody,
you know, laughed at Tom Lee every time
he went on like, how do they invite this
guy on? He's constantly wrong. These
sorts of things, right? Tom Lee is going
to usually take the bullish perspective.
And in a bull market, it's looks
amazing, right? But when the market
flips and you go to that other side,
right, and um you know, somebody like a
Tom Lee that keeps taking the bullish
perspective and the market keeps working
against him, he starts to look like, you
know, he's got pain on his face and
people start saying like this guy
doesn't know what he's talking about,
right? Where and the flip happens. Um I
already saw the flip happening this
weekend in regards to X. Like people
don't hate Tom Lee yet, though. Uh but
people are definitely
talking negatively about him in regards
to his Ethereum loss. His Ethereum loss,
people were showing that this weekend.
It's one of the biggest losses in
history. I mean, it was approaching
people were showing his Ethereum loss at
approaching $6 billion this weekend on
X. Like that's a crazy number, right? Um
shoot. So,
you know, we'll see. Okay. Next up here,
I want to react to this guy who's got a
very bearish take on Bitcoin. and we'll
hear what he has to say.
>> They've been absolutely smashed in
recent months thanks to the the drop
we've seen in the Bitcoin and the crypto
space. Strategy has seen down 7.6% to
Coinbase 4.7% down. Circle internet down
3.8 Galaxy 7.6.
>> Michael Sailor is the ultimate you is I
was going to say his posts on X are
nuts, but yes,
>> that's not fair to nuts. Um, no, but
they are quite extraordinary anyway. And
it's kind of almost I don't know. know
he's almost like kind of messianic if
that's not you know wrong to say but my
point is Michael Sailor is the original
DAC digital asset currency chat and he
is the biggest holder biggest advocate
on the planet of crypto uh he has been
buying more but he's now underwater he
owns hundreds of thousands more than
most people out there apart from your
government
>> El Salvador I think he owns more than El
Salvador but the fact is he's underwater
now so this is getting tight there
>> well he's not the only one I mean I
spent a lot of time with Brian Armstrong
over at
about volume rather than holding the
position.
>> It's about a lot of things. I think
let's get to John Blank, chief equity
strategist at Zach. John, now we've just
sort of set the scene there around
Bitcoin. What do you think? What's
what's the outlook look like,
>> Karen? You know, generally speaking, a
Bitcoin winner is 12 to 18 months long
and these are well understood technical
features. So, at 76,000 from 125,000,
which was the
>> Amazon just arrived. That means Amazon's
delivering, which means Amazon earnings
are going to deliver. Baby, Amazon truck
just showed up.
>> Winner is 12 to 18 months long. And
these are well understood technical
features. So at 76,000 from 125,000,
which was the peak, we can get to 40,000
40,000. So if we get to this Rubicon as
Steve spoke to, which is basically being
called out by Sailor because of his
positions, what when does it before
selling and liquidations happen to take
us to 40,000? we can get there very
quickly or more likely we're going to
get there over the next 6 to 8 months.
>> But John, we've got a crypto friendly
president. We've got a president that is
friendly for all sorts of digital coin
and this is why the market has been
unwilling to bet against that. They've
been a cautious.
>> So like
people still don't understand that's not
a good thing for Bitcoin.
It's not a good thing. People assume
like oh that's great news like the
government's for Bitcoin. No, dude. Do
you forget the whole plot?
The whole thing about Bitcoin from the
very go was it's anti-government,
right? Government doesn't have a hold on
it. The Wall Streeters, they don't have
a hold on this asset. You know, we're
creating our own thing and you know,
screw Wall Street, screw the big banks,
screw the government. Like, Bitcoin's
our thing, right? The people's thing.
That's all been removed. Now, Bitcoin is
a Wall Street asset. Big money controls
Bitcoin. Big money now controls whether
Bitcoin goes up or down on a daily
basis. The government is all like, "Oh,
we're so pro this and so pro that all
these different cryptos and things like
that."
That that that goes against like the
whole thing. This is not good. Like
people have always tried to pitch this
the last few years is like, "Oh, this is
a great thing." like, you know,
government's, you know, so pro crypto
and Trump blah blah blah. And I'm like,
dude, this is not good. This is not
good. You can talk yourself into
whatever you want to talk yourself into.
But you got to understand like
from the very go what mattered and
didn't matter in regards to these
assets. And so once you got the
government involved, once you got the
big money, the Wall Street involved,
that's not a good thing. It is not a
good thing.
>> A huge downward draft here. They're
still cautious that friendly policies
from the Trump administration could be
forthcoming. Would you bank against
that?
>> Well, I just think, you know,
everything's tied to the stable coin act
and the stable coin act still playing
out. So, you know, the president
generally doesn't like actual policy and
getting involved in it. You know, he
likes emergency orders. So, the problem
here is the crypto guys bet on the wrong
guy who has to been to put a stable
framework into place, which is the the
the stable coin act which is playing
out.
>> But this is still a negotiation. I was
talking to Brian Armstrong about this
the other day. They want some sort of
reward when it comes to the stable coin
which would take on and challenge the
deposits that you've seen of banks. So,
so this is still up for grabs at this
stage.
>> Well, absolutely. I mean, the whole
stable coin thing is not stable. This is
the basic problem. I mean, they're
trying to create demand. They tried
through the ETS, now it's trying to
stable coin. And this is the other
problem here is is how how long has that
game been played? You know, that play
get played out for years. And there's
also a generational issue. People tired
of this this whole trade. Tired of it
because co's over. tired of it because
there's other Coinbased things to do.
But that speaks to Robin Hood outside of
Coinbase, right? Robin Hood's doing
great. Coinbase not so much. So, we're
we're in this other thing which is is it
stale to be in Bitcoin? Basically,
I mean, do you think do you agree with
the some of the other commentary that's
that's been around around this? Uh, I'm
thinking um the global market strategist
at Marx who said that what we're seeing
is an asset in search of a valuation
model. There's no clear consensus on
what actually drives the price of this.
Does that reflect your view or do you
>> Yeah. The the issue you run into now
that Wall Street controls Bitcoin, now
that Wall Street controls, you know,
these different assets is they're going
to move
when they want them to move. So, if they
want to, you know, have those babies
manipulate them to not go up for years,
that's exactly what they'll do. Have you
paid attention to silver over the years,
like decades? like they'll have time
periods where silver just won't move for
years and years and years and there's
been like investigations in regards to
manipulation the silver markets and all
those sorts of things over the years in
regards to commodities market right and
um so like you could easily go through
many years where Bitcoin really doesn't
move right like it goes up goes down but
it's not really like going on that like
insane move like when it went from you
know 10,000 to 70,000 right back in what
was that 2021 when it hit alltime highs
at 70,000, right? Um like they they'll
move it when they want to move it,
right? And if that's this year, they'll
move it this year. If it's in five years
from now, they move it five years from
now, right? And you just have to
continue to hold year after year after
year like hoping like somebody's willing
to pay more than what you bought it for.
>> You disagree with that?
>> Well, you know, there's a there's a
thesis that I think get should get more
airtime in financial markets, which is
called the the inelastic financial
markets hypothesis, which is prices in
financial markets are inelastic. So you
put a lot of demand in the price goes up
dramatically more than it should have.
So this is really inelastic financial
markets hypothesis is crypto. You talk
it up, you pump it up and you create new
sources of demand and the price is
inelastic and it explodes, right? But it
explodes up and down. So when the market
gets unlquid, it's going to multiply
much faster and pull away. So I think
the other thing here is you know
inefficient inefficient markets have
gone towards inefficient markets because
of this inelasticity of people just
chasing the same stuff chasing too many
trades too few change
>> and and do you see that as being a
specific problem to um certain types of
crypto or do you think it's a broader
issue that would call into question the
wisdom of central banks um holding
strategic reserves in cryptos?
>> Yeah, I think so. I mean getting the
central bank in on these types of trades
with total inelastic markets that would
just be this massive surge in liquidity,
massive surge in prices and that would
be you know take it another level to
hire. So any this is why they're talking
to the president. This is why he got on
his side because they know this story.
They know they need another source of
demand and they need a big one. A couple
of points, car, you said that Trump's a
fan of crypto. And you know, obviously I
think I understand that, you know, him
and his family of of um are involved,
but the Trump memecoin has fallen over
90% in the last year.
>> I just saw the last print, 4.1 I think
it is. Um it hit 75 bucks at its high.
John, um come back to us on this. I'
I've just told the.com to have a look at
your $40,000 comment. So I need some
more flesh on it so they can make a bit
of copy for you. Um, why is 40,000 the
level?
>> Well, if you take, you know, the last
the highs out of the last cycles of tops
of the Bitcoin and and the lows, you're
going to get a kind of a megaphone
pattern, right? And so, this is just
calling the the the extension of that
chart to 40,000 for this move. That's
what I'm saying.
>> Um,
on the way down, sorry, we started off
by talking to Mr. Sailor and what have
you and the digital asset currency
people. That's going to wipe a load of
them out.
>> Absolutely. So the question is who's
behind all of his liquidity? What banks?
What what lending? What does what kind
of stops does he have in place in his
mind? And how does he play this out?
Because he's going to talk one game and
play another, right? He's a trader.
>> So he, you know, I I've noticed many
many traders, work with a lot of them in
in the company I'm in, they'll say one
thing, but if the market turns against
him three days later, they're they're
doing a different trade
>> for sure.
>> Got it. Yeah. And I can go
>> listen preach. Okay. Like we see we
react to these Wall Streeters all the
time on uh this channel, right? And uh
pay attention to their views on the
market and these stocks and like one
minute they could be bullish on the
stock and 3 days later they're bearish
and they're like, "Oh, I'm selling out."
And it's like, "Really? You were so
bullish on this stock like 3 days ago
and now you're selling out?" You know,
Scott, whenever he interviews these Wall
Streeters, right? It's always
entertaining. Okay, Dan Niles next up
here.
>> Is Nvidia and this may not happen. I
want to make that very clear. It was a
journal story over the weekend if Nvidia
were to pull back or out of that $100
billion OpenAI investment. What would it
mean if anything?
>> Well, I mean, I think it shows you how
the world has changed from September,
but we kind of know that, right? In the
sense that or there's a reason Oracle
stock is down over 50% from its 52- week
high following that monster quarter they
put up in the middle of September. So I
think you know what will be interesting
is what the amount ends up being because
remember when that agreement was signed
in September
the it was for 100 billion but it was a
letter of intent. So they didn't
necessarily need to follow through on
that and you saw in filings from Nvidia
since then that they said you know this
might not ever get done. the CFO CE CEO
have said that in conferences starting
as early as January as far as I can
remember. So this is not in some sense
new news per se, but it does tell you
that Nvidia clearly thinks a lot
differently about Open AI than they did
in September of last year.
>> And what should you know, we were just
talking about this, what should Open AI
do, Dan? I mean, you don't have to worry
about it, I guess, because it's not a
>> In a moment, I'll explain exactly why
Nvidia has gone sour on Open AI. I'll
explain to you exactly why
>> traded equity itself. But if you're a
Microsoft investor, if you're Oracle, as
you mentioned, um, in some ways, if
you're Nvidia, I mean, those are the
chips powering uh, their chatbot,
whereas with Google, they have it kind
of all vertically integrated.
>> Well, yeah, but Google does use Nvidia
chips as well. So I think this comes
down to what's been happening really
since October 29th before that 5% draw
down in the S&P back then or if you look
at the Google ecosystem of companies
since October 29th they're up about 25%.
>> Yeah.
>> If you look at the open AI ecosystem of
companies they're down about 25%.
And some of the latest releases from
Google just make me feel that much
better that Google's going to ultimately
be the winner in consumer AI and
Anthropic is going to be one of the
winners in enterprise AI and Open AI is
in trouble because they're wedged
between the two of them.
>> Okay. So,
>> and so let let's stay let's stay there.
Open open AI, we don't know if it's in
trouble or not, but if they don't get
100 billion, even by Open AI standards,
100 billion is a lot of freaking money.
Okay. If
>> Oh, no. I think they're going to get a
hundred billion dollars, Brian. I'm not
saying they're not. I'm just saying
longer term, if you are thinking about
who the one to three winners are going
to be in AI, I don't think they're going
to be one of them. Are they going to
raise the 100 billion? No problem.
There's too many companies that have a
vested interest, at least for right now,
for funding it.
>> And so, they're going to raise the
money. It'll be interesting to see what
happens. They'll raise it and they'll
burn through it. Right. So,
>> so uh before we go further here, why did
why has Nvidia gone sour on Open AI?
Here is my personal opinion on how I
read this situation. Okay, Nvidia seemed
to go sour on Open AI after a very
important thing happened. Do you know
what that is?
OpenAI made an announcement that they're
going to potentially get some ownership
in AMD and buy a massive quantity of AMD
chips over the next several years. Okay.
Now, if you're Nvidia, that's got to be
frustrating to you, right? You're like,
"Wait a minute. We're supposed to invest
a ton of money into you. We're going to
invest money into you and then you're
going to go around and spend a fortune
of money with our competitor AMD. You
don't like that.
That was the moment where things started
to turn sour between the relationship
and my personal opinion and everything
lines up. Before that, Nvidia is so pro
open AI. Oh, you know, Jensen all a
sudden now sounds like like we never
said, you know, and it's like, oh my
gosh, like what a what a change in
tonality in a matter of a few months,
right? But I I can and I can understand
it from Nvidia's perspective of like
where we're supposed to give you a ton
of money, then you're going to go spend
that money with our competitor, right?
Like Nvidia probably wants all that
money to be spent right back with
Nvidia, right? And so now, you know, I
don't think this administration is going
to look at it from a monopoly practice
standpoint, but
there's some things in there that you
could look at as kind of a little sketch
about like, you know,
investing into a company so they spend
it back with you, right? Um, they don't
spend it with your competitor. And I
mean, there it's definitely some sketchy
stuff in my personal opinion, right? And
once again, the with the folks in the
government that are in the government
right now, I don't think they're going
to look into any of this. But
if Linda was still there,
I'm not sure some of these tactics would
be going on right now. I will say that
about this. Okay.
>> Absolutely.
>> Let me ask a different question.
>> In three years, in five years, if Open
AI is something totally different than
it is now, it's bought. If OpenAI
doesn't make it or is sold off or what
whatever happens, maybe it's the king,
but let's say it doesn't. Will the stock
market be okay? How much, if anything,
is riding on Open AI given that it's
kind of a a black box, kind of a closed
thing? It's not a public company. We
don't know a lot about it.
>> A ton's writing on it because you know
that they've made $1.4 4 trillion in
commitments over eight years and they're
going to lose money all the way through
2029 and the burns are going to get
worse every year that passes until then.
So yeah, a lot is riding on it, but
you're seeing the stock market, as I
said, it's been adapting to this since
late October. What I find fascinating
today is you look at Oracle, right?
because they're obviously when they
announced that monster quarter back in
September of last year, the stock was up
36% the next day. Biggest move in
history for any company with a market
cap of over a half a trillion dollars.
But 300 billion or almost 2third of the
remaining performance obligations were
from OpenAI. So Oracle comes out this
morning says, "Hey, we're going to raise
50 billion, you know, half of it in
equity. Stocks up and now it's down."
And so it tells you that people are
thinking maybe a little bit beyond.
Okay, they can raise it for this year,
but what about next year and the year
after? And so it's it's it's never the
data, it's how the market reacts to the
data. Clearly this morning it was, oh my
god, this is great. And now it's like,
well, wait a minute, we still have the
same problem we had before, which is
their exposure to Open AI. So if open AI
doesn't work out here, is it devastating
to the overall stock market?
Not that much. And the reason being is
so many of these stocks have already
started to discount that open AAI might
not be able to raise as much money as
people previously thought. You know,
whether it be this year, next year, and
future years and things like that,
right? And so if you look at like Nvidia
is a good example. Nvidia's 4P right now
is in the 20s, right? Oracle stock is
less today than when they made the open
AI announcement. So there's already been
a massive discount there. So you know
not as much is riding on that as maybe
people would have perceived. If Oracle
stock was flying high right now, if
Nvidia was 275, it would be a very
different situation, right? But the
market's already very cautious on this
whole situation, right? And also, if
OpenAI loses, you can see many companies
potentially win in that environment,
right? One of those most beneficai
sentiment has soured over the last
several months, look at Google's
sentiment. It's higher than it's ever
been. and look at how strong that stock,
you know, remains. And congratulations
to everybody that's obviously made a lot
of money on Google stock. Okay, I
