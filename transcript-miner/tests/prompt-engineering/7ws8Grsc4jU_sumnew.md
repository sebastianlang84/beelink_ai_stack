# Macro: Global Debt Destabilization and Coordinated Currency Shifts

## Executive Summary
- Japan's sovereign debt crisis has transitioned into a global currency risk affecting the US Dollar.
- A coordinated policy shift between the Fed and the BOJ aims to weaken the USD and strengthen the JPY.
- The US Dollar Index (DXY) is breaking a structural uptrend that has been in place since 2011.
- Investors are moving away from fiat currencies toward hard assets like gold and silver due to unmanageable debt levels.

## Key Points
- Japan's debt is the largest in the world when adjusted for GDP, acting as a trigger for global debt instability ("largest in the world when adjusted for GDP").
- Japanese bond yields (10, 30, and 40-year) have surged to 20-year highs, reflecting a loss of investor confidence ("bond market is in complete collapse").
- The Bank of Japan is expected to choose "money printing" (yield curve control) over default to cap yields, which typically devalues the currency.
- The US administration is actively seeking a weaker dollar to boost domestic manufacturing and industry competitiveness.
- A "coordinated policy shift" similar to the 1985 Plaza Accord is underway to manage exchange rates.
- The US Dollar is estimated to be significantly overvalued; a 10-15% decline in the DXY is possible if current strategies succeed.

## Numbers
- metric: Japanese Debt Pile | value: 10.1 | unit: trillion USD | context: Third largest in the world by nominal value.
- metric: US Dollar Index Decline | value: 4 | unit: percent | context: Recent loss of purchasing power relative to the Yen.
- metric: Potential DXY Downside | value: 10-15 | unit: percent | context: Possible decline if Trump administration breaks the overvalued dollar.
- metric: Bond Yields | value: 20 | unit: year high | context: Japanese 10-year Treasury bond yield levels.

## Opportunities
- Shift toward foreign markets denominated in stronger currencies to avoid US "currency risk."
- Increased exposure to commodities (gold, silver) as the "bigger shift" away from fiat currencies accelerates.

## Risks
- "Currency risk" for holders of US dollar-denominated assets as capital flows to foreign markets.
- Potential for a complete collapse of the Japanese Yen if the BOJ's money printing is not supported by US intervention.
- Global debt fabric destabilization triggered by Japanese bond volatility.

## Unknowns
- The exact duration and scale of the BOJ's rumored bond-buying program.
- Whether private investors can overwhelm the coordinated central bank intervention.

## IST-Stand
The US Dollar is breaking a 15-year uptrend. Japan is facing a bond market panic with yields at multi-decade highs, while the US and Japan are actively coordinating to prevent Yen weakness and force Dollar depreciation.

# Stocks: Impact of Dollar Depreciation on Equity Allocations

## Executive Summary
- US dollar-denominated stocks are becoming less attractive due to rising currency risk.
- A weaker dollar may boost US manufacturing competitiveness but could lead to capital outflows from US markets.
- Investors are encouraged to increase exposure to foreign equity markets.

## Key Points
- US assets face "currency risk" where the underlying value may drop in foreign currency terms even if nominal prices stay flat ("might mean that in euro terms... it does go down").
- The US administration's strategy to weaken the dollar is intended to "boost American manufacturing and industry."
- Capital is expected to flow away from the US stock market toward foreign markets with stronger currency backing.

## Numbers
- none

## Opportunities
- Ramping up foreign market exposure to capture gains in stronger currencies.
- Potential upside for US exporters/manufacturing stocks due to a more competitive exchange rate.

## Risks
- Outflows from the US stock market as international investors avoid the declining dollar.
- Nominal gains in US stocks may be offset by the loss of purchasing power of the dollar.

## Unknowns
- Which specific foreign markets will benefit most from the US capital flight.
- The timing of when the "10 to 15% decline" in the dollar index fully reflects in equity pricing.

## IST-Stand
Braavos Research is currently "ramping up foreign exposure" in response to the perceived structural decline of the US dollar and its impact on US-denominated equity attractiveness.
