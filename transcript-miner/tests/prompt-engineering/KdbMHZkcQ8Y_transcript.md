Pilenteer just did it again. It shocked
the world. It has sent the investing
community into a frenzy and it
absolutely blew everybody's mind. That
is if you're not in the Roy Academy.
Yesterday in the morning time, we all
got together about 9:30 a.m. and we
talked about Palunteer earnings ahead of
it. And I basically said, "Look folks,
we're heading into earnings with super
negative sentiment. The stock is
basically plummeting 10% into earnings.
Palanteer based on history is going to
do what it does every single time which
is beat and smash. That means that this
setup is perfect. I think Palanteer will
have spectacular earnings. So if I had
to guess, I think they're going to go
and they're going to beat and the shorts
are going to get. So what's going on
right now if you take a look so so
Palanteer over the past few days is down
more than 10%, right? 11% 12% depends on
when you check it, right? So when the
stock drops into earnings double digits,
usually that price is in a very negative
scenario. So this completely flips the
picture. So if we would have came into
this earnings, I'm going to explain to
you guys how this works. If we would
have came into this earnings flying
super high, right, the margin of error
for us would be very very small because
this the the results have to be
spectacular for you to keep flying high
when everybody is already super super
bullish.
What actually is going on because the
stock drops 10 11 12%. So right now the
threshold that that that piloter has to
meet with these earnings is not as high
as it was 5 days ago because the
sentiment essentially has already priced
in the worst possible outcome. So if
Palanteer just slightly beats revenue,
slightly beats EPS and gives decent
guidance,
there is no way it keeps coming down if
it came in at 12% into earnings. You
understand what I'm saying? Right now
we're going in super low into earnings.
that put it puts me in a very calm state
of mind because I'm saying look they
just got a beat and you know the stock
is going to keep flying up that that's
going probably what's going to play out
right it's like look at the last four
earnings
okay what happened with the past four
earnings and go one by one by one with
revenue one by one by one margin etc
client acquisition etc etc and then
you'll see the real picture we predicted
this we saw it happen we were super calm
super relaxed and that's the benefit of
being in the academy now here's the
thing Just to say this without sounding
like an If you panic sold
Palunteer into these earnings because of
everything you heard in social media,
that means you didn't have the right
conviction in the stock. That means you
shouldn't have been holding it to begin
with. If you want to be able to hold
through moments like this through what
happened the past week, you have to
build conviction. Now, more on that at
the end of the video, but let's go over
the earnings first because in this
video, I want to show you the most
fantastic earnings we have ever gotten
from this company. And we have gotten
some crazy numbers, but this is probably
the craziest of them all. In this video,
we'll talk about the earnings. I'm going
to break it down, going to offer my
analysis, my investing strategy into the
next 5 years, and of course, my own
opinion about everything that's going on
social media, where this company is
headed, because there's a lot to unpack
here. There's a lot to learn. If you are
a Palunteer investor, this video is
something you must watch all the way
through the end. So don't click nothing,
don't smash nothing, don't buy nothing,
just listen. So Palunteer reported
earnings with a 70% revenue growth. That
is insane. Now what's even crazier is
that Palanteer is literally guiding that
this year is going to end at 60% revenue
growth, which is staggering numbers. Now
it hit a rule of 40 of 130 between 140
depends on who you ask. Now it doesn't
matter if it's 130 or 140. This is one
of the highest numbers in existence.
Essentially what the rule of 40 measures
is empty calories, right? If you have
high growth numbers and you're growing
sales and revenue and everything is
going crazy, but you are not making
money, you're going to be slammed with a
very low rule of 40. Because the rule of
40 takes into account two things. your
growth numbers and your free cash flow
margin. Now they combine them to get a
number and strategically historically 20
and 20 would be very very good which
means 40 is the optimum. If you can
present a hybrid of 40 between your
revenue growth and your free cash flow,
then what you're going to get is a rule
of 40 of 40, which is exquisite chef's
kiss. Pilot just gave you 130 140, which
means it is literally three times higher
than the best score you could hope for.
These are literally video game numbers.
If you had to create a company that's a
complete cheat code, that would be it.
Now, on top of it, we got 140%
retention. Now net dollar retention
basically measures how much dollars we
have made from existing clients from
past year to current year. So
essentially every single client have
spent a$140 more than the previous
dollar last year. How many companies can
show you that for existing clients to
spend 40% more? That is insane. That is
a very very good number combined
with the rule of 40. These are imaginary
numbers. If we were talking about this
before Palanteer, that would not have
been realistic. We would have gotten the
comment that this is not real because no
company can exist under these
parameters. Right now, if you take a
look deeper, the numbers get even
better. So, Palant is operating 80%
gross margin, which is insane now. Right
now, we're running at 1.4 billion per
quarter. That number is going to go up.
Right now, commercial growth in the US
is 140% as it was expected to be by me
and by other Palunteer watchers across
social media, not the analysts, but we
knew this is going to happen because the
entire US market, the entire tech market
is basically obsessing about Palunteer
because it's literally the only way to
apply AI into your business with the
safety features, with the regulation,
and with the efficiency. There's nothing
else like that. We'll talk about in a
second. That's why Palunteer is carrying
4.3 in total contract. Basically, TCV is
up 140% from last year. So, Palunteer is
essentially refusing people at the door
because there's not enough capacity.
It's overs subscribed. You can just look
at what's going on with the boot camps,
what's going on with the other stuff
Palanteer is doing. Everybody wants in.
Now, this year they're going to make
$7.2 2 billion in revenue, which if you
follow the history is a significant
increase than what we were talking about
just a couple years ago. Now, EPS grew
80% year-over-year, it's growing 20%
quarter over quarter. That's earnings
per share. Now, on top of this, if you
look at revenue quarter over quarter,
it's growing at 20%. Most companies
would be happy to give you a 20% annual
growth in revenues. Pilenteer is happy
to give you a 20% quarterly growth from
previous quarter to this quarter.
Revenue increased 20%. These are
unrealistic numbers for any other
company with the exception of perhaps
Nvidia and Palunteer. These are the only
two companies who can give you numbers
like this. Now check this out because
this is super interesting. Right now Q4
net income last year last year was $79
million which is impressive. Definitely
impressive. But check this out. From
last year to this year, net income went
up from 79 million to 68 million. Net
income up 7 and a half times in a year.
Show me a company that can produce such
revenue growth 70%. At these margins, so
that the net income is increasing 7 and
a half in a year. You're not going to
find that anywhere else except Palanteer
and maybe Nvidia in the good old days
before it started kind of mellowing down
a little bit. These are unrivaled
numbers. You're not going to find it
with any other company now. If you look
deeper, you're going to find something
even more interesting. Right? So the
rule of 40 right now is 140, 130,
doesn't matter. Right? Just 12 months
ago. 12 months ago, not that long ago.
12 months ago, the rule of 40 was 81. So
pany went from 81 which is in itself is
a spectacular rule of 40 number to 140.
Reminding you again this is the revenue
growth and the free cash flow margin
combined in 12 months going from 81 to
140. Insane. On top of it, US revenue
grew 93% year-over-year and US
commercial revenue is growing at 140%.
So it's showing you that the US
commercial growth is essentially driving
the bus here. But if you're sleeping on
government, wait because there's other
stuff I want to show you because
government is actually probably one of
the most misunderstood parts about
Palanteer right now. So right now
commercial growth for Palanteer is 82%.
Government growth is 60%. I want to
remind you that a few quarters ago
some analysts were dunking on Palunteer
because the government growth was not
high enough. So it's currently going at
60%. Now I think that this part the
government growth sector is probably
right now the most misunderstood part
about Palunteer. As much as people are
starting to get the idea of commercial
growth, exponentiality and all that AI
and all that. People still sleep and
misunderstand on what's going on with
governments. The governments of the
world is essentially the most
misunderstood part about this business
because all of these big countries right
now, they're all in a massive arms race.
Back in the day, they would build tanks
and guns. Right now, it's an AI arms
race. They're essentially buying their
way into the game because the next
warfare is going to be handled through
AI. So, everybody's overspending on AI
for defense. and name me one AI defense
contractor other than Palanteer. There
is none. Tina, there is no alternative.
So, government spending is about to go
exponential. People still don't
understand this. And the only game in
town is Palanteer. That 60 is going to
go up. It's going to rival commercial
growth, which is going to create a
two-headed monster like we've never seen
before. Now, moving on. Check this out.
I'm going to show you a few companies
which are monopolizing their own
category, their own industry. And I
think it's fair we talk about these
companies. So in the world of GPUs,
Nvidia is the clear monopoly. Well,
let's call it a duopoly with AMD. But
right now, they're the big boy, right?
It's a $4.5 trillion company. TSMC is
the monopoly of producing
semiconductors, the foundry. It's a $1.7
trillion company. Google is the search
monopoly,
$4 trillion. Amazon is the cloud leader
at $2.5 trillion. Microsoft is the
leader in business software, but also a
big cloud player with Azour at 3.2
trillion, right? And Apple is the leader
in consumer tech, essentially a monopoly
on its own. If you do an average of
these companies, the average market cap,
the average market cap of these
companies is $3.8 trillion. Okay,
companies that monopolize technology in
their own industry on average about the
$3.8 trillion sector average. If you
look at Palanteer, which is a monopoly,
not a quasi monopoly like some of these,
an actual monopoly, because there is no
alternative, Palanteer is valued at 350
billion right now in the market. meaning
that Palunteer is 10x cheaper than the
average monopolistic tech company in the
world right now. Just goes to show you
how far we have to go before we get to
max potential for Palunteer. And I know
it's not what analysts are saying. I
know that people are overfocused on PE.
We'll talk about that. Okay, it's not my
first rodeo here, but I'm telling you
right now, Palanteer is still massively,
massively undervalued. So, Palanteer
currently has one of the cleanest
balance sheets in existence, right? It's
a company that's giving you a balance
sheet with over $7 billion of cash with
zero dollars of debt and a 55% free cash
flow margin. There's not a lot of
companies that can do that, right? And
the remaining performance obligations
are almost $5 billion. So at this point,
Palunteer already has almost $5 billion
of work of sales built into the system
before they even sold a single one.
That's cheat code numbers right here.
And that's just by glancing at the
balance sheet, the free cash flow, and
the RPOS's. Now, by the way, RPOS's here
don't mean um run pass option for you
football lovers. Okay? So right now what
we have with Palunteer is a quarter that
gave us one of the best historical
growth and profitability numbers from
Palanteer. They were impressive to begin
with, but that's even better. We have a
super scalable business. The rate at
which the costs are coming up is
minuscule compared to the increase in
sales. Right? We have an AI explosive
growth right now driving Palunteer into
the stratosphere because again there is
no alternative. It's not just about the
AI stuff for the commercial side. We're
also looking at the government side. On
the government side there are incredible
opportunities for Palunteer. The time on
the government side is massive. And with
government clients, the business is so
much better because we're talking about
longer duration contracts. These
military DoD contracts, they're for
decades. We're talking about large scale
contracts, hundreds of millions a pop,
sticky. They're not going to switch
providers every two years. And with
national security and del globalization
being one of the main trends for the
next 5 years, this government sector of
Palanteer literally has a 10x potential
for the next four years. Yes, the
government business of Palunteer can
grow 10x in four years because of all of
that. You have to understand that humans
have a tough time dealing with
exponentiality. This is prime example of
why most analysts are messing on palente
still in 2026. So as AI decision-m in
business and in the government sector is
going to 10x over the next few years,
that's obvious. Palunteer is the only
operating system that can run this
safely, securely on the regulation
perspective, on efficiency. So they're
absolutely agnostic to who wins AI model
wars, hardware wars, which businesses
come out on top. Palunteer does not care
which company dominates which sector. It
does not matter to palunteer. They're
absolutely agnostic. Companies don't
like spending money. CFOs don't like
writing checks. If a company is spending
on average 140% year-over-year with
Palunteer, that means that these
companies have no other choice. That
means that they are replacing legacy
builds with Palunteer. They're killing
their Frankenstein whatever they had
before. That means that uses expansion
is causing more uses expansion. The more
you use Palunteer, that's the loop. The
more you need to keep using it. And the
total operating integration of Palunteer
into businesses is now in a place where
it simply cannot be severed. It is now
part of the US economy in a way that can
be untangled. So Palunteer is getting
larger deals. is increasing its customer
count and it has a very lean operating
model which means that it scales and
scales and scales and their revenue is
coming up and the margins is coming up.
That's why you see rule of 40 growth
from 45 to 68, 26, 240 in just a couple
years. But Tom, what about the PE ratio?
Okay, let's talk about the P ratio,
right? So the P ratio is very high.
Depends on who you ask. I'm not going to
get into it because to me the P ratio
never matter. Pet Lynch said, and this
is a sentence that stuck with me for
years, that there is no bad time to buy
a good company. Now the P ratio of the
past 5 years, I heard about this
argument day in day out, day in day out.
But while I was hearing people arguing
about the P ratio, the stock price since
2022 did 27x.
If you invested in a very high PE ratio
in Palunteer, $50,000 just 3 years ago,
you would have had 1.3 million in your
account with the high PE ratio. Did the
P ratio prevent you from going 27x from
2022 to right now? Of course not.
Because it does not matter. It does not
matter if you're investing in a good
company. Time is the best friend of a
good company in the stock market. None
of this is a one-time thing. Like PE
ratios, they matter as part of an
analysis. And there could be situations
where a company has a high PE ratio that
still is extremely undervalued. It could
happen. It doesn't happen every day.
It's a massive outlier, but when this
outlier happens, you have to be able to
identify it. You can't be robotic and
just say, "Well, anything above 50p, I'm
not touching." That's not the right way
to invest in tech. If you're a tech
investor, you have to be smart about
your decision-m. Now, I promise to
explain to you why Palunteer is agnostic
to whoever wins the AI wars. Okay?
Imagine the whole AI stack as something
like this. All right? You have the GPU
builders, cloud providers, storage, API
and deployment, monitoring. Okay? This
is the AI stack. On top of the stack,
you have large language models, the chat
GPTs of the world, the cloud agents,
open claw, all that stuff, right? So
there's a lot of competition in this
stack between GPU providers. So you have
Nvidia dominating, AMD is trying to
catch up, cloud services, they're
competing between themselves, storage,
API, all of this is in a massive
competition cycle. Okay? Some companies
will win, some companies will lose. But
this layer, the LLM layer, is
essentially commoditized already. So
this is becoming what I call a USB
cable. Okay? LM are now about to become
a fullon commodity. The money will be
made here in this stack. But guess what?
This whole stack is built on the
foundation layer, which is Palanteer.
There is none of this without Palunteer.
Without this foundation layer, the
operating system, none of this can
really be applied to real businesses,
which is why Palunteer dominates. Now,
let me just show you this in another
way. So, imagine there is a race and we
have all of these competitors trying to
get to the finish line to see who wins.
The cloud providers are competing, the
LLM builders, the hardware builders, the
power providers, the cooling, the all of
them are racing to the finish line.
Whoever wins in each category gets to be
number one. And in this world, usually
the winner takes all in these worlds.
Right at the finish line, you've got
palunteers sitting, waiting, essentially
having popcorn saying, "Hey, whoever
wins, whoever of you guys wins, we're
going to have a relationship with."
Honestly, Palanteer simply doesn't care
who wins. Whoever of these guys wins,
we're going to make money with building
an AI system for the next generation.
That's as simple as that. and these
earnings. If they don't make it insanely
obvious to you, then so be it. Invest in
something else. I don't care. But it's
pretty obvious to anybody with some
understanding of this business that
Palunteer is the real deal. Palunteer is
him. And that's why Palunteer has been
the main stock I've been talking about
for 5 years. That's why we have it on
our top stocks list in my academy for
many years since way back when. That is
why we're really good at what we do
because we analyze fundamentals. We
understand business and we ignore the
noise. This is how you make money. It's
really easy to get rich slow in the
stock market because all you got to do
is find good businesses and hold on to
dear life and ignore the noise. That's
it. Now, if you want to learn how we did
all this, how we fund Palunteer, how we
fund a bunch of other stocks, you are
welcome to join our academy patnash.
We will teach you how to get out of this
spin cycle you're on with mainstream
media and news and all this stuff. We
will show you the path into proper
long-term investing so you can do the
same thing we've done for the past five
years. Look back and say, "Oh my god,
I'm a completely different investor
now." Join us. I would love to have you
on. Thank you. Go Palunteer. I'll see
you in the next one. This
