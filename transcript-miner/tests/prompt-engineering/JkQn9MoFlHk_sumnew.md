# Stocks: Superinvestor Portfolio Overlap and Performance

## Executive Summary
- Analysis of four investment legends (Buffett, Pelosi, Ackman, Gates) reveals a massive divergence in individual holdings with only a 2.5% overlap.
- Despite different styles, three specific "pillars" (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple) are identified as the core consensus among the smartest investors.
- Performance over a 5-year backtest varies wildly between these legends, ranging from a 2x return to a 6.5x return on initial capital.

## Key Points
- High divergence in strategy: Out of 120+ combined holdings, the legends share only three stocks ("97% of their portfolios don't even touch one another").
- Alphabet (Google) is a consensus pick for Buffett, Pelosi, and Ackman representing the "search" pillar.
- Amazon is viewed as essential infrastructure due to AWS and logistics ("AWS logistics and consumer scale are infrastructure right now and they're not optional bets").
- Apple is the third consensus stock, held directly by Buffett and Pelosi, and indirectly by Bill Gates.
- Bill Gates' exposure to Apple is derived through his significant stake in Berkshire Hathaway ("indirect for Gates through his nearly 30% position in Berkshire Hathaway").

## Numbers
- metric: Portfolio Overlap Rate | value: 2.5 | unit: % | context: Shared holdings among 4 legends out of 120+ total positions.
- metric: Maximum 5-Year Return | value: 65,000 | unit: USD | context: Growth of a $10,000 investment in the top-performing legend's portfolio.
- metric: Minimum 5-Year Return | value: 19,000 | unit: USD | context: Growth of a $10,000 investment in the lowest-performing legend's portfolio.
- metric: Gates' Berkshire Stake | value: 30 | unit: % | context: Bill Gates' ownership level in Berkshire Hathaway providing indirect Apple exposure.

## Opportunities
- Focus on the "three pillars" (Search, Cloud, Consumer Brand) that bridge different investing styles (Value, Political/Growth, Activist).
- Identifying "infrastructure" bets like AWS that are deemed "not optional" by institutional legends.

## Risks
- Style Underperformance: Even legendary status does not guarantee market-beating returns, as one legend "barely even doubles their money" in a 5-year bull window.

## Unknowns
- The specific identity of the legend who achieved the $65k return vs. the one who only doubled their money is not explicitly mapped in this snippet.
- The full list of the 120+ non-overlapping holdings.

## IST-Stand
- The current market consensus among top-tier investors (Buffett, Pelosi, Ackman, Gates) is heavily concentrated in three mega-cap tech names (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL) despite vastly different overall portfolio compositions.
