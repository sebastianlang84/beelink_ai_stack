## Summary
Palantir released "spectacular" earnings results following a period of negative sentiment and a double-digit stock price decline. The company reported 70% revenue growth and maintains high forward guidance, significantly exceeding market expectations that had already priced in a "worst possible outcome."

## Key Points & Insights
- **Pre-Earnings Sentiment:** The stock fell 10–12% in the days leading up to the earnings call, creating a "perfect setup" where even a slight beat could trigger a price reversal.
- **Beat and Smash History:** The speaker notes that Palantir historically beats and surpasses expectations, contrasting with the negative social media sentiment that drove panic selling.
- **Efficiency and Growth:** Combining massive revenue growth with a high "Rule of 40" score indicates Palantir is operating at one of the highest efficiency levels in existence.
- **Conviction:** Investors who sold during the 10% dip lacked the underlying research to hold through volatility; the speaker emphasizes that high-conviction investors were "super calm."

## Numbers
- **Revenue Growth:** 70% reported in the current earnings.
- **Projected Revenue Growth:** Guided to end the year at 60%.
- **Rule of 40:** Between 130 and 140 ("This is one of the highest numbers in existence.").
- **Stock Price Decline:** Down 11% to 12% in the days immediately preceding the earnings announcement.

## Chances
- **Short Squeeze:** Expectation that "shorts are going to get" due to the significant beat against negative sentiment.
- **Recovery:** High probability of the stock "flying up" because the negative sentiment had already priced in poor results.

## Risks
- **Sentiment Volatility:** The stock is susceptible to large swings (double-digit moves) based on social media sentiment and short-term panic.
- **Margin of Error:** Had the stock entered earnings at a high price, the "margin of error for us would be very very small."
