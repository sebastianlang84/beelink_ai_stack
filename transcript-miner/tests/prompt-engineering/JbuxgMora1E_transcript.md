Hello everybody. So this video is
entitled Wall Street Dumps the Future of
Finance. Nine stocks that I'm going to
quickly cover, but let me just say I
could have just called this video Wall
Street dumps the future period. Not just
the future of finance. I see articles on
CNBC trending from chips to chips a hoy
and they're celebrating that people are
investing in potato chips. Are you
kidding me? This market is so crazy.
Let's go with this video and let's see
what is happening. So, of course,
everything that makes sense is crashing.
Everything that makes sense right now is
crashing. Everything that has a time
horizon of a few years ahead is
crashing. So, we have SoFi. So is down.
Well, I guess it's only down 1%. Okay,
bad example, but SoFi is still crashing.
We should be at like 28 to 30 right now.
This is nonsense, but it's down nearly
2% after such an amazing Q4. This stock
is now well into my buyable category,
trading as 0.29.
Let's continue with Robin Hood and the
Robin Hood copycats, as I'm going to
call them. No offense, they're not
exactly copycats, but they're very
similar. It Toro and Bull, of course,
these are being sold off as a basket.
Toro down 5%, bull down 3%, Robin Hood
down 3% after a minus 10% day yesterday.
For what? What is going on? Like the
these companies are mostly stocks. I
know the narrative of the market is to
try to say they're mostly crypto. They
are not. They are mostly stocks. This
makes absolutely no sense. Wait, is
Schwab winning? I is is Erade winning?
Is Schwab winning? Is who's winning the
broker race? Is it is is it is it these
old world brokers that are winning? Is
it is it JP Morgan Chase brokerage who's
winning? Is it Wells Fargo brokerage
who's winning? These three companies are
clearly taking most of the capital away
from these legacy institutions. I would
maybe only put Interactive Brokers as
the one company that puts up a good
fight. But but make no mistake, the the
younger investors, i.e. those who will
make most of the money going forward and
those who will inherit who will inherit
most of the money going forward. They're
using Robin Hood. They're using Weeble.
They're using Coinbase. They're not
going to use Wells Fargo brokerage. This
makes absolutely no sense. This drop
makes absolutely no sense. And I cannot
believe I am telling you this, but Robin
Hood just fell into my buyable uh
category at 0.47. We're under 0.5. We
are buyable. Robin Hood is buyable at
these levels, which is crazy cuz Robin
Hood was high-flying for the past, you
know, 7 8 months, maybe 10 months was
high-flying. So, makes absolutely no
sense. Let me move on. Let's talk about
Bitcoin. Actually, as I record this,
Bitcoin is in the low 75,000.
Is in the low 75,000.
Strategy still outperforming Bitcoin, by
the way. Strategy falling in line with
Bitcoin while it should be technically
falling much more than Bitcoin, about
50% more. Um, so is the future of money
dead? Is Bitcoin dead? People are
getting all carried away with with some
some some criminal investigation having
to do with some people. I don't know. I
don't really care. Like what I care
about is is gold is it what's the future
of money? We know it's not fiat. Fiat's
going to zero. So is it going to be gold
or is it going to be Bitcoin and and and
and again the bear is for studying.
Study Bitcoin. The bear is for studying.
And I kind of went went on a tangent.
This should be a separate video. But I I
want you to consider that most of the
people who are buying Bitcoin are in
China. Most of the Bitcoin sorry uh gold
are in China. Most of the gold run is
from China. Most of the gold run is from
China. Now China is ahead of the United
States in a lot of sectors but it's not
ahead in the United States in one key
sector which is space. Right? SpaceX is
probably 100 times ahead of any China
space program. SpaceX is American. And I
want to point out point point this out
to you that this this is not that far
for fetch. In fact, mining an asteroid
is less forfetch than going to Earth. In
fact, asteroid mining is much more
economical from a from a standpoint. And
if they run gold to like 10,000 an
ounce, I want to point out that there
are near-Earth asteroids that are not
very far. Four of them that are
metallic, entirely metallic asteroids
with with very very high concentration
of gold. You see, spend a little time
studying physics. Why is there no gold
on Earth? There is next to no gold on
Earth because when Earth was formed,
most of the gold went to the core of the
earth. This is not the case for
asteroids. In fact, if you follow a lot
of physics video, if you ask AI, I have
a conversation with AI, look at the part
per million, 0.00001 per million versus
10 ppm for for an asteroid. So, there's
10,000 times more gold in the sky for
some asteroids, which depending on their
curves, you know, depending on the the
depending on the season, they don't get
that far from us, right? They're not as
far as Mars. They they rotate close to
Earth sometimes. So, it's a matter of
you send a mission, you send a machine,
they mine the gold. Four years later,
when the asteroid goes by Earth again,
you collect all of the gold. This is
something that SpaceX could entirely do
within the next few years. In fact, NASA
is is looking at at missions for 2029.
And if if there's a specific one that's
that's near Mars, that's a little
further away from Mars where there it's
called the golden asteroid where there's
700 quintilion, which is enough gold to
make everybody on Earth a billionaire.
So gold has lasted for 5,000 years. If
you think gold is going to last for
another for another thousand years when
we have clearly SpaceX who's
revolutionizing this space, this is a
big threat for gold in my view. There is
no doubt that the future of money is not
gold. People are so short-term. This
deserves an entire video and I realize
that it seems that far-fetched, but it's
not that farfetched. It's actually not
that farfetched. And when we start
talking about money, we need to talk
about ex extra long periods of times,
you know, like in hundreds of years. In
a 100 years, you don't think this is
going to happen in 100 years. No, this
is definitely happening in a 100 years.
So, so, so anyways, moving on. Right.
But anyways, MSTR, Bitcoin being sold
off. The future is entirely being sold
off. There there is no foresight just
over than the next quarter or the next
Fed chair right now. It's very
frustrating for a channel like me who's
all about long-term investing. Moving
on, let's talk about two stocks that are
still to be studied in greater depth
than me. Um, of the I mean, I like both.
I think I think Coinbase's move into
stocks is a really good really good
idea. Coinbase, the fact that they
operate base and they they they they
have a lot of um things going with
Ethereum and with their base layer two.
I don't like that as much about
Coinbase, but I do like uh the fact that
they have a very heavy partnership with
Circle um early investor and Circle. So
Coinbase and Circle very interesting
company. I would I would argue that
Circle needs my attention. Circle is
down 66%. So that's a much better deal
than what Coinbase is. And if you look
at circle, how many USDC are
circulating? We're up 108%
year-over-year. There's 108% more USDC
stable coins now than there was a year
ago. So this company is growing at a
more than 100% rate and it's down 66%.
So clearly stable coins are the future.
Clearly stable coins are going to
disrupt Visa, Mastercard, and the banks.
And now we're in a phase where the banks
are fighting and they're fighting
really, really hard. But you can't do
anything with technology. Nobody uses
horses anymore. No, like you know you
know the
the horse people they fought really hard
in Henry Ford, right? But they they
didn't win. They didn't. It took a
decade. There was no horse no more. So
anyways, this makes absolutely no sense
to me. The fact that these stocks are
selling off like this the the
gosh, God bless the private markets.
Seriously, God bless the private
markets. If I was a public CEO, I would
not go public right now. I would not go
public. uh stocks are being held
hostage. They they are they are
literally punching balls. And of course,
I've invested for a very long time,
okay? Like in the 2010s when this was
every over 3 to 5 years, like that was
fine. But this this is like I mean I
mean we had three grace ones in January
and it continues in February and 2025.
We had two dark gray swans in the form
of 10 10 and liberation day. So this
market is not for the faint of heart.
Believe me, it's not for the faint of
heart. I keep saying this. The 2020s
don't get wiped out. The 2020s don't get
wiped out. That's what it is. Anyways,
let's talk about PayPal. So, another
stock, the CEO's gone. Uh, you know
what? I um I used to follow a little bit
PayPal 2 years ago back when I was um
you know kind of establishing an opinion
as to whether I should buy it or not. 2
years ago I decided to not buy it. Why
did I decide to not buy it? Well,
because the growth rate is no good for
me. It's 6% growth rate. You're growing
less than money supply. So, I'm not
interested. Um it it's it's uh it's very
easy. It makes me very comfortable to
just entirely avoid stocks that don't
grow the top line at more than 30%. But
I remember listening to the early calls
with Alex Chris. I I thought he had a
really really good strategy. Well, turns
out he got fired today and he's getting
replaced by someone else. Uh and you
know, can you really judge a strategy in
about two years? Is two years enough?
Right. This this gives me the odd feels
of what happened with with CleanSpark
and them switching the CEO as the stock
stock price didn't go up like like no
stock price is going up right now. It's
right now it's it's a complete mess in
the market. If you look at fintech, it's
a complete fintech. So So uh you know I
will listen to the call of PayPal
because I don't follow this stock too
closely but clearly down 20%. today. To
me, it seems like an overreaction. I
would, even though it's it looks like
it's in viable territory for my
spreadsheet. You see, I would not be
interested in clean in in PayPal because
it's only growing at 6%, which I'm a
growth snob. So, 6% is not enough for
me. But for a value investor, I think I
think at 41, it's looking pretty darn
interesting for a value investor. And if
there's a lot of very highly respectable
people um who are who are you know
honored value investors who like it as
value investors uh clearly to me this is
another reaction and the only thing that
that make would make me possibly like
PayPal is their stable coin efforts and
their buy now pay later BNPL efforts. So
I'll be listening to the call uh this
afternoon and see see what's going on
with PayPal. This seems like an like a
like an absolute over overreaction. Um,
you know, I'm I'm not sure changing the
CEO is doing anything when the stock
prices are influenced by shortterm Wall
Street thinking and influenced by things
that have nothing to do with a company
fundamentals. You know, um,
you know, we we always say in Bitcoin,
if you don't want to own Bitcoin for
four years, you shouldn't own it at all.
I think we need to extend that sentence
to all stocks. any stock if you don't
want to own it for four to five years
you probably shouldn't own it at all
because the market is absolutely
nonsense right as a HIM shareholder I
see it today with HIMS down more than 5%
after dropping 2% yesterday after
dropping 10% the day before so so if
PayPal is a is anything like him if
PayPal is a punching bag how many stocks
are just punching bag like even Nvidia
Nvidia is down over 3% today it was down
3% the day before like they're literally
writing articles from chips
to aoy chips, potato chips. Like we're
going to invest in potato chips. Oh my
goodness. Anyways, the market is crazy.
Uh special mention, I could have
mentioned Solana as well, which is which
is likely part of this future of finance
which is being sold off for absolutely
no reason because it's firing on all
cylinders. So this market is wild. Your
assignment is to not get wiped out as
always. That's the job. That's the only
job. So sorry for the rant. This was not
investment advice. This is not financial
advice at all. I have no idea where this
madness is headed. No financial advice.
