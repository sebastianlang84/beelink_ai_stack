Two headlines dropped this week. Nvidia
backing off Open AI. Oracle in a debt
crisis with 30,000 layoffs on the table.
Wall Street wants you to panic. Sell
everything. AI is dead again, right?
Well, if you're short on time, if you've
got like 30 seconds before your boss
catches you watching YouTube trash
videos like mine at work, here's the
only thing you need to know. This is not
an AI demand collapse. This is AI
growing up. It's transitioning from a
hype cycle into a finance cycle. The
question isn't is AI dead. The question
is who's holding the longduration risk
and at what cost of capital. Nvidia
backing off mostly a deal structure
thing. Oracle's debt situation. That one
actually matters more for systemwide
risk. And I'm going to show you why with
actual numbers, not vibes.
So, uh, hey, I'm Data Cat. Welcome to
the channel if you're new here. Quick
background on me. I spent years as an
analyst inside a Fortune50 company. And
look, I'm not going to sit here and
pretend I was some genius making
million-dollar calls. I was the guy in
the spreadsheet trenches, you know,
running iterations of models until one
actually works, questioning my life
choices, wondering if my cat was judging
me while I suffer from serious imposttor
syndrome. Anyway, about 6 months ago, I
traded all that and started this small
channel. still figuring things out
honestly, but I wanted to create
something where retail investors like
you and me could actually get the same
analytical frameworks the institutions
use without the jargon gatekeeping. No
courses to sell you, no Discord pump
groups, just, you know, me and data and
the occasional cat joke because I am who
I am. So, if that sounds useful, maybe

show this to other people who might find

Let's get into what's actually happening
here. Now, here's the thing. If you've
been following markets at all in 2025
and now into 2026, this fear cycle
should feel familiar. We've literally
done this dance multiple times already.
AI fear, AI, fine. AI fear again. It's
like the market has the memory of a
goldfish. Or actually, you know what?
Goldfish apparently have decent memory.
The market has the memory of someone who
walked into a room and forgot why
they're there. Every few months, a
headline drops. AI bubble bursting.
Markets dip. Then a week later, the
earnings numbers check out. Everything's
fine again. The thesis was never
actually broken. But we still got
spooked every time. So when I saw Nvidia
and Oracle headlines pop up again this
week, my first thought was, okay, is
this actually new information or is this
the same story all over again? Turns out
it's a bit of both, and the nuance
matters. Let's start with Nvidia. The
headline says Nvidia is backing off its
hundred billion investment in open AI.
100 billion written out. That's like
annual GDP from a midsize country. So
when you hear backing off, your brain
goes, "Oh no, Nvidia's abandoning Open
AI. AI demand is crashing." But hold on,
let's look at what actually happened.
According to Reuters and Techrunch,
Nvidia's CEO characterized that 100
billion figure as, and I quote, not a
commitment and not finalized. CNBC
reported the two companies discussed
building 10 gawatt of compute together
with the investment number being the
source of uncertainty. Ah to me this
looks like renegotiation of deal size
and terms, not a categorical Nvidia is
done with OpenAI forever. Think about it
like this. If I told you I was thinking
about maybe possibly spending $100,000
renovating my kitchen and then later I
said actually it might be 60,000 and I
want different payment terms. That's not
me abandoning my kitchen. That's me
negotiating. And honestly, there's a
legitimate reason Nvidia might want to
reshape this deal. When you invest
heavily in your own customer, it creates
exactly what the news has been calling
out, the circular financing optics.
Naturally, it raises questions about
whether demand is real or artificially
inflated. And right now, by stepping
back from the mega check, Nvidia might
actually improve its optics without
changing actual GPU demand one bit.
Honestly, I think the headlines nowadays
are just obsessed with manufacturing
fear. Everything has to be a crisis.
Everything has to signal doom. Now,
think about it. AI or not. To be fair,
being prudent about deploying billions
is just normal. Like, that's what you're
supposed to do when you're running a
company. Due diligence, negotiation,
making sure the terms make sense. That's
literally corporate finance 101. And no
wonder Jensen said the company is in a
no-win situation with the media. Like if
Nvidia spends huge money happily, throws
checks around like confetti at every AI
startup. The headlines scream wasteful
circular financing. This proves it's a
bubble. But if Nvidia spends prudently,
does actual due diligence, renegotiates
terms that don't make sense. The
headlines scream they're pulling back.
AI demand is dying. Sell everything.
It's exhausting. You literally cannot
win. My cat does the same thing, by the
way. I feed him too much. He ignores me.
I feed her the right amount. He acts
like I'm personally starving him. no-win
situation. But hey, at least Jensen gets
paid better for dealing with it. So,
first order impact, open AI might rely
more on other investors. Nvidia looks
cleaner to institutional money. Second
order impact, maybe some cooling of the
AI euphoria narrative. Markets start
distinguishing between companies with
real cash flows versus pure story
stocks. But what this does not mean is
that AI compute demand is collapsing.
Nvidia sells chips. Whether or not they
also become a major equity investor in
OpenAI doesn't fundamentally change
that. Okay. Now, Oracle, this one's
different. This grumpy old cat has more
teeth. So, what's the situation? Oracle
announced it expects to raise 45 to50
billion this year through a combination
of debt and equity. 50 billion. That's
still half of a midsize country annual
GDP just to fund cloud infrastructure
buildout. Meanwhile, they also got sued
by bond holders who alleged the company
concealed how much additional debt would
be needed for AI related spending. And
there are reports unconfirmed
officially, of 20 to 30,000 layoffs,
roughly 10% of their workforce
potentially freeing up 8 to 10 billion
in cash flow. Now, is this a debt crisis
in the sense of imminent insolveny? No.
Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps
actually fell about 17% after they
announced the financing plan. Markets
saw that as reducing tail risk, not
increasing it. But, and this is
important, this is a real financing
stress story.
Boring time, but let me show you the
numbers from a few metrics. Oracle's
total debt is approximately 131.7
billion. Cash plus short-term
investments is about 19.8 billion. If
you do simple debt to cash, you get
roughly 6.7x ratio. That's not cashri,
that's leveraged.
Now let's also look at its leverage
relative to earnings power which sits at
around 4.6x ratio. In most credit
frameworks, anything above four times is
considered stretched. Not apocalyptic
but reduced margin for error. And in
terms of interest coverage, actually
fine. Operating cash flow is about 22.3
billion. Cash interest paid is about 3.4
billion. That's coverage of over 6x,
which means they can service their debt
comfortably.
But then here's the key number. Free
cash flow. Oracle's capital expenditure
in the last 12 months is - 35.5 billion.
Free cash flow is -3.2 billion. Now
under the context of them burning cash
to build AI infrastructure, they are not
self-unding at all. This means their
debt safety depends entirely on three
things. Sustained operating cash flow,
continued ability to raise capital at
reasonable terms, and eventually capex
tapering as buildouts complete. If any
of those break, the math gets ugly. Like
really ugly. So, what's the verdict?
Easy. Oracle's near-term liquidity and
interest servicing is still manageable,
but leverage plus negative free cash
flow is stretched. This isn't immediate
balance sheet danger, but it's also not
safe. It's a financing dependent
expansion posture. They're betting the
farm on AI infrastructure demand
materializing on schedule. The key word
here is on schedule without extra
headwind in a relatively long time
horizon.
All right, so here's the part Wall
Street doesn't really frame clearly for
retail investors. The question isn't,
are Nvidia and Oracle failing? They're
not, at least not at the moment. The
systematic question is, are capital
markets starting to ration funding for
AI infrastructure? Because if they are,
if banks demand higher spreads, if
investors pull back, if credit gets
tighter, then the entire AI buildout
slows down, data centers, power
infrastructure, networking, GPU
clusters, everything.
Nvidia backing off. Open AI is mostly
idiosyncratic. It's about deal
structure, valuation, strategic
positioning, not strong evidence of
systemwide stress. And Oracle situation
that's got a more systemic edge. When
markets scrutinize Oracle's leverage,
when litigation shows up, when CDS
spreads swing wildly, that can spill
over into broader data center financing
terms and investor appetite for AI
infrastructure plays across the board.
Oracle is basically a canary in the coal
mine for AI buildout financing
constraints. The signal from both
stories is AI isn't dying, but AI is
transitioning from a period where the
limiting factors were technology and
talent to a period where the limiting
factors are power, land, chips, and most
importantly, cost of capital. That's a
maturation, not a collapse. So, what do
you actually do with this information?
One, don't panic sell on headlines,
especially headlines you've seen before
in slightly different forms. Two, if
you're holding AI adjacent names, start
paying attention to balance sheets.
Companies with negative free cash flow
and high leverage need capital markets
to stay open. That's a dependency.
Dependencies are risks. Three, watch
credit spreads. Oracle's CDS movement is
a real-time barometer of how markets
feel about AI capex financing risk. If
those spreads start widening
persistently across multiple names,
that's a signal. And four, remember that
infrastructure buildouts take time. AI
revenue hasn't caught up to AI spending
yet for most of these companies. That
gap creates volatility. Volatility
creates opportunity if you understand
what's actually happening versus what
headlines want you to feel. So yeah,
that's the update. AI thesis broken? No.
AI growing up and forcing harder
financial questions? Absolutely. If this
kind of breakdown was helpful. If you
want more of this read past the headline
analysis, consider subscribing. I'm
trying to build something genuinely
useful here. No fluff, no hype, just
data and frameworks. Drop a like if you
made it this far. Leave a comment if you
disagree with anything. I actually read
those and sometimes or maybe half of the
time I'm wrong. My cat certainly thinks
so. All right, thanks for watching.
