for Jeremy to be recording a video at
9:30 a.m. There's got to be drama out
there. And oh boy, do we have drama,
folks. This is a very rare occurrence,
as in like this never happens. A 9:30
a.m. video. You got to be flipping my
flapjacks. Okay, we got stocks crashing
all over the place out here. It's a
blood bath, right? Uh look at Fubo down
21%. Look at PayPal. Oh my gosh. Just
when you think like this stock has to
bottom, does it ever bottom? No, it
doesn't. And it's now 4222. That might
be actually a good sign. Uh down 19%.
Look at Shopify getting Shopified here
today down 10%. Service now down 7 12%.
Adobe down 7%. Salesforce is down 7%. We
got stocks crashing all over the place
that we got to speak about here today.
Right. I posted this 28 minutes ago on
X. If you ever want to follow me on X,
that's always linked in the description
area down there. Public count's such an
animal. I have two stocks literally
crashing today plus others getting hit
hard, right? and public accounts down
like $57,000, right? Like that's
nothing. And that's where position
sizing comes in. Diversity is so key in
regards to that, right? So, I want to
speak about kind of bigger picture for a
moment at the beginning of this video.
Then, we're going to get into PayPal,
PayPal. Is it a buy? Is it a sell? Is it
just a kind of don't do anything type
situation. Uh I did spend $70,000 on
stocks by the way, just uh probably
about what 20 minutes ago, 10 minutes
ago, something like that. Right. Fubo.
Uh, we'll speak about what's going on
with Fubo. Is that a it's over situation
or is it an overreaction? Then I want to
react to some videos. Uh, I think this
one's important. Julian Emanuel. Mood
around tech is as cautious as I've seen
it since chat GPT launched. That's an
important video. Palanteer obviously
reported just an unbelievable quarter
last night. And the stock is not really
being rewarded. I mean, you could look
at it up 6% today and be like, well,
yeah, it's getting rewarded. No, that
was an A++ quarter. That's the only A++
quarter I've ever graded in the history
of me grading income statements. It's
not really being rewarded. So, I think
it's actually important we speak about
Palanteer in this video here today. And
then we're going to go watch this one
because this is an interesting video cuz
we're talking about some bottom fishing
today, right? And this gentleman Harvey
says, "Don't go bottom fishing for
stocks." Busy times, folks. We're
action-packed time. Uh it's earning
season going on right now. One thing,
one thing only I need from you guys if
you could just smash a like button for
me. That's all I need from you. Okay?
And I appreciate you for being here. Uh
if you want to be subscribed, you can
certainly subscribe to the channel.
Okay? Before we get into this, let's
just talk bigger picture, okay? When
you're going through a a pain moment
like this, listen,
this is the cost of doing business. You
want to be a big boy. You want to get to
the big money.
There's no other way around it.
Sometimes your stocks are going to
crash. Sometimes the whole market's
going to crash.
Big deal. It's the cost of doing
business. There's no way you can climb
to the big ranks without going through
this. No one's ever done it before. It
can't be done, right? I don't care who
you look at, the best investors of all
time, they've all had to go through
stock market crashes, and they've all
had to have, you know, go through
markets where their stocks are crashing.
And the market's actually not crashing,
right? They've all had to sell for
losses. Sometimes millions, sometimes
hundreds of millions, sometimes billions
of dollars of losses, right? It's the
cost of doing business. And if you can't
get over, there's really two pain things
you have to go through in the stock
market. One is all the research work,
right? Listen to conference calls, doing
all your study, right? That's a pain
point that some people don't want to go
through. And the second pain point you
have to go through in the stock market
is guess what? Sometimes your stocks are
going to crash, right? And you're going
to get hammered about, oh my gosh, I'm
down this much, that much on this stock,
that stock, right? And those are two
pain things. Not everybody can tolerate
that pain. Not everybody can tolerate
it, right? Um, you got to choose what
life you want to live, right? In I went
to where I went to high school, we were
really good at football back in those
days, right? And we had some great
football coaches and I played football
all four years starting freshman year
all the way to senior year, right? And
uh, football was always interesting
because everybody wanted to be a
football player at my school, right?
Because we had so much respect, right?
All the girls wanted to get with us and
all the guys wanted to be us, right? So,
the beginning of every football season,
a lot of kids would, you know, try to
join the the football team, right? And
then they would start going through
those three-hour practices out in 100
plus degree heat in Phoenix, Arizona,
right? And they were like, "Ah, hell
with this." Right? You got to go through
those tackling drills and you got to I
mean, it's just you're putting your mind
and body on the line every single day
and it's just like they're like, "Oh,
the hell with this." Right? So those
kids would, you know, obviously drop out
of the team after a few weeks and but
they would always come to the games and
they always, you know, what you would
always hear is, "Man, I wish I should
have played football." Like, "Oh, I wish
I would have been you guys," right? Um,
and so you got to you got to either you
got to either be the person in the
stands or you going to be the person on
the field. It's up to you, right? You
can choose what you want to do. You want
to be on the the field or you want to be
up in the stands. And I can tell you,
the only way you get to the big money,
you better be on that field. So, you
have to choose which life you want to
live, right? I obviously chose the life
I live and I lay in my bed now 17 years
later, right? Um, and in that process,
you go through a lot of crashes. A lot
of times your stocks are going to crash.
A lot of times you're going to have to
sell stocks at a loss. Cost of doing
business. Cost of doing business. It
just is what it is, right? And so, you
know, do I feel any different today than
I did yesterday? Nothing. If anything, I
feel more charged up actually when we
have drama. I'm almost like secretly
wishing, you know, AMD crashes after the
bell today, too. I'm like, let's just
get it on, man. Let's just go. Let's
just full go, right? You know, it's just
h if anything, I get more charged up
when there's drama out there in the
market, right? Okay. So, let's get
rolling here. PayPal first up. So, oh,
PayPal. Where do I even want to start
with this one? Let me start here.
I saw the stock price move. What was the
first thing I personally did? Right?
Like what is somebody like myself, I
wake up, I look at my stocks, I'm oh my
gosh, PayPal's down 19%. What's the
first thing I did? What did I do? Did I
go to my Discord chat in the private
stock group?
No. Did I go see did they beat or miss
earnings? No. You know what I did?
Little secret for you on what the big
players do. went straight to their
investor relations page and went
straight to their income statement
because my thought is like, is this a
disaster? Right? I don't want to I don't
want other people's opinions to clout my
judgment in regards to this. Let me go
look at the income statement before I
look at anything else. And let me just
see is this really bad or is this not so
bad? And what do I find in regards to
PayPal? Uh it's a very good income
statement actually. It's a B+ grade. Not
quite a grade. growth wasn't quite good
enough and they had a couple categories
that were uh a little higher than you
know you would want but still a B+ grade
overall. Revenues were up 4%.
Transaction expense was up 6.5%. So that
was a bad spot for the company. However,
transaction and credit loss is actually
down 10%. That's good news. Credit uh
customer support and operations down 1%
which is good when you're growing
revenue, right? They I mean, you know,
4% doesn't seem like that big of a
number, but keep in mind that's still a
300 plus million. You know, was that
$310 million more in revenue this
quarter versus the same quarter last
year? It's pretty big number. So,
customer support and operations down
1%'s good. Sales and marketing was up
quite a bit for the company
year-over-year. That was up 10%. But
keep in mind, that's a pretty small line
item, right? You know, if you look at
sales and marketing, that's not even
10%. What is that? Like 7% or 8% of
revenues, right? technology and
development. Uh that was up up 4% but
that's you know roughly in line with
what revenue was up. GNA down 15%
year-over-year was good news.
Restructuring other this was a bad item
for the company. That was a 60% in uh
increase year-over-year. So you know but
that's usually more one-off stuff. So
don't make big judgments based upon
that. So total operating expenses was up
3.5% year-over-year, right? Versus
revenues up 4%. That's a win. There's no
other way to put it. Like revenue is
always going to be a much bigger item.
And so if your revenue is up 4% and your
total operating expenses up 3.5%, you
won. Operating income up 5%
year-over-year for the company to $1.5
plus billion. They also had other income
here of $116 million. Income before
income taxes, $1.6 billion from 1.4
billion in the same quarter last year.
Net income was 1.43 billion from 1.12
billion. That's a 28% increase
year-over-year. and diluted EPS was $153
versus $111 in the same quarter last
year. It's a 38% increase. Okay, so
let's be very crystal clear about
PayPal's numbers.
Factually, those are good, solid
numbers. Are they great? Is this
Palunteer? Absolutely not. This is not
Palunteer. Okay, but are those good
solid numbers? Yes.
At the end of the day, if you if you ran
a business and your business is has
revenues increasing year-over-year,
right, 4%. And your net income is going
up at a much faster clip and your
earnings per share is going up even
faster clip, you won. You won. Right
now, if you trade at dirt cheap
valuation metrics, you extra one. Right?
Now,
you might say, "Okay, so numbers are
solid. Why is a stock selling off big
then, right? It comes down to one major
thing, and I didn't have this on my
bingo card." And this is where I speak
about sometimes things are going to
happen in the stock market, you never
expect it, man. And something really big
happened today. Listen,
they basically canned Alex Chris. He's
out.
Didn't add that on my bingo card. I was
not expecting that. Not expecting that.
Whoa. Alex Chris gone. A lot of people
don't like that. And so
it's a tough position to be in because
from one side I look at PayPal and I'm
like what Alex Chris has been able to do
in regards to the profitability of the
company, the buyback, all those sorts of
things has been impressive.
However, there's one thing he has not
been able to do certainly that is not
very impressive. And let me show you.
Okay, so here's the problem with PayPal
in you know where Alex Chris is
let's just put it this way where he has
missed right if you look at trailing 12
month revenue growth for PayPal 4%. 4%.
Right? Look at somebody like Visa on a
trailing 12-month basis 12%.
Right? That's where we run into the
issue with PayPal and with Alex Chris is
he has not been able to accelerate the
revenue growth the way you would have
liked or have expected, right? However,
look at the valuation of the stock. It
is insanely I mean it was already a
super cheap stock. Now you just crash
the stock another 20%. It's like cheap
on cheap. Right? Now, if their
profitability was eroding, right, let's
say their net income, their earnings per
share was going down, then I would say,
okay, PayPal at a 74P, like uh you know,
that doesn't mean it's cheap because
look at their net income's going
negative. Their earnings per share, but
factually their earnings per share is
increasing and net income is increasing.
Now, you could maybe have an opinion
that maybe that's going to be different,
right? And maybe that's not going to be
the case moving forward and maybe uh you
know their net income's going to start
going down. Their earnings per share is
going to go down and then if that
happens then you can make an argument
that PayPal had a seven forward P is not
cheap right because their profitability
is literally going down and so but the
moral of the story is here as long as
net income and earnings per share keep
increasing they don't even have to
increase the way they've been
increasing. As long as it keeps
increasing, it's still a dirt cheap
stock that's trading way too cheap and
is a great buyout candidate, right? I
mean, you're looking at PayPal now. You
know, I don't know PayPal's market cap
pulled up right now. But PayPal's entire
market capitalization of this company,
my guess after today,
I don't know, $40 billion or something
like that. Like, it's got to be so dirt
cheap, it's ridiculous. Um, like it's
insane. in regards to PayPal.
You know, this is a market cap in the
40s now in regards to like and they got
a massive cash load on the company as
well and doing hu huge share buybacks.
So, when you think about it from that
context, like I think there should be a
lot of companies looking at PayPal to
buy them out. Why would you not? They're
trading dirt cheap. Got a great income
statement and balance sheet just
factually. That's like that's not an
opinion. like it's just facts, right?
You get PayPal, Venmo, you get the
Brainree side of the business as well.
Yeah, it's not the fastest revenue
growth, but you know, you can get a good
payback on this in a fairly quick amount
of time because what you could end up
doing is you're going to be able to like
let's say somebody like a bigger company
bought PayPal. Okay, what you'd be able
to do is gut a lot of the expenses off
of PayPal essentially, right? Because
there's there'd be a lot of duplicated
rules. like if a parenting company
bought it, you wouldn't need nearly as
many employees and things like that
because you already have people to
handle it, upper management, things like
that, right? And so the profitability of
PayPal would even go up to a greater
extent. So I think it makes a lot of
sense for a lot of companies to look at
PayPal as a buyout. Like
you might have to pay 60 or 70 billion,
but keep in mind that it also has a lot
of cash on the balance sheet as well. 60
to 70 billion for the whole company. I
don't think that's like a crazy number.
So if I
if I were in a bigger
company, I would seriously that that is
anything in relation to somebody like a
PayPal, I would seriously look at
potentially buying them out and um
they're still growing. It's not like
revenues are, you know, shrinking 4%.
Then you say, okay, you're getting like
this melting ice cube. Revenues are
still going up for the company, right?
And then earnings per share at even a
faster clip. Now, as far as a new CEO,
that that's a big question, right? Like,
are they going to be able to do a great
job? I don't know. I don't know.
And so, PayPal, I don't think it's a
sell today, right? And I know obviously
a lot of people selling PayPal stock
today, right? It's down 20%. You don't
go down 20% unless a lot of people are
selling. I know a lot of people are
selling today. Actually, don't think
it's a sell, right? We could debate that
maybe it's not a buy, right?
Me personally, what did I do today? I
bought some PayPal shares. I held my
nose and I bought some. Okay, with that
being said, did I load the boat? No, I
didn't. Because I'm even uncertain about
this new CEO and kind of, you know, what
their strategy is going to be. Are they
actually going to be able to increase
revenues the way Alex Chris was not able
to, right? I don't know, man. I have a
lot of questions about that.
Lot of questions. Alex Chris came in
very confident. Going to shock the
world. You know, I don't think he the
thing is with Alex Christ. Did he shock
the world? Absolutely not. Right. He
laid an egg when it came to that. But I
also don't think he did a bad job. When
I look at his overall tenure at PayPal,
I don't think he did a bad job, but he
did not shock the world. Right? Shock in
the world would have been get back to
double digit revenue growth. If he did
that, that would have been shocking the
world. Like, whoa. Like, that's insane.
Like, he he did it right. Um, he was not
able to accomplish that, but he did a
good job. I mean, like, look at the
numbers. Like, look, B+ great income
statement. That's a good job. He did a
good job. Bought back tons of shares and
um, you know, ran the company pretty
lean, more profitable than it's ever
been in its history.
But, PainPal, man. Pain pal, that's what
we call it. Okay, Fubo. Next up here.
So, in regards to Fubo, fiscal 2026
marks a step change in our trajectory.
Having successfully closed a Hulu Plus
live TV combination, we have established
a strong foundation and a scaled
platform with 6.2 million subscribers.
While this enhances Fubo's position in
pay TV, our ambition is to scale further
and rival industry incumbents. Today, we
accelerate that pursuit with our
announcement of plans for a new reseller
of marketing a and marketing arrangement
with ESPN. Per COM score, ESPN reached
more than four out of every five US
adults in November 2025, representing
hundreds of millions of unique fans
across ESPN's digital and other
platforms. We are working with ESPN to
include Fubo Sports in ESPN's commerce
flow, which we expect to lower our cost
of acquisition
and position Fubo as a premier
destination for fans. This arrangement
is subject to negotiation of definitive
agreements. 2026 is a year of scaling
with purpose. With the integration well
underway, we are focused on expanding
our reach, driving higher yields through
our com combined ad tech and enforcing
portfolio discipline to maximize
margins. Simultaneously, we are
accelerating our product roadmap to
deliver the next generation of consumer
centric innovations specifically in
product technology and packaging that
differentiate our offering. We look
forward to keeping you updated as we
unlock full potential. So, as far as
numbers went here for Fubo, actually
pretty decent. Okay, look at this. Look
at this. Total revenue $1.54 billion
from $1.1 billion. Operating loss was
$20 million versus $38 million loss in
the same quarter last year. That's a
huge improvement. Um, huge improvement,
right, for the company year-over-year.
As far as net loss for the company, 19
million versus 38 million. So basically
cut that in half. Net loss attributable
to common shareholders of 5.9 mil um
from 38 mil. Right? So now as far as
this net loss attributable to
non-controlling interest, that's really
the 70% that's from uh Disney now at
this point in time, right? Because
Disney has a massive um controlling
interest obviously in Fubo now at this
point in time, right? So
with Fubo, I think people are upset
about like the lack of guidance and
maybe clarity on things. This is, you
know, what I've always talked about in
regards to Fubo is this is a year where
by the end of the year you're going to
have a lot of clarity on Fubo. Like what
are realistic growth rates? What's
profitability looking like? Where
exactly is a business model going?
Right? And I've talked about like right
now it's cloudy, it's murky, it's like
hard to see, right? But I think by the
end of this year, you'll have a lot of
clarity in regards to exactly what's
going on with Fubo. Now, additionally,
they're also doing a reverse stock split
here. We'll see what it comes in at.
Might be like a you know,
a 10 to one or something like that.
We'll see what happens with that reverse
stock split. So, basically how it's
going to work is, you know, right now
Fubo's I don't know $1.70. So, let's
say, you know, they increase the share
price to $11.70,
right? So if you had 10 shares before,
now you'll have one share, right? So
there's no difference in terms of the
amount of money just like a regular
stock split is like all ends up being
the same. It's just you change the share
price. So we'll see what they end up
doing in regards to that. That's
honestly irrelevant. Like you know,
maybe it moves the stock price up or
down shortterm. Maybe that's part of the
reason it's down today, but it's really
honestly meaningless. By the way, I wore
my red thousandx hat since there's so
much damage out there today. So uh Fubo,
listen. Did I buy some right now? Yeah,
I did. I bought some Fubo here today. Uh
I think in regards to Fubo, it's an
attractive riskreward. I just have to
keep position sizing small. And that's
the thing like how many like what did I
put in Fubo today? I put like five grand
or something like that, right? Which,
you know, for me is not a you know,
obviously a large amount of money, but I
did buy it. And so I look at as it's one
of those stocks. It's it's you know that
huge epic opportunity to you know
potentially 10x or 20x or 30x right so
but it's also one of those that comes
with a lot of risk as we know right um
but the way I kind of look at a stock
like that is it if I'm right and let's
say it is that 10x type opportunity
right a small amount of money goes a
long way I don't need to risk the farm
because maybe food well doesn't work out
right maybe they do this reverse stock
split and then it falls another 90%
You never know. Uh, but I think things
are looking more promising than ever
regarding Fubo. There was a time period
when this stock was very scary and very
ugly. The balance sheet's loaded now
with cash. I don't know if you guys have
seen that. I mean, it's incredible. Uh,
the change in regards to that situation.
They were talking about it. Where is it
at here? If we look, let's pull it up.
Look at this. Cash and cash equivalents
here. $452
million.
That's a big number. That's a big
number. $452 million. They're loaded.
They're loaded with money now at this
point in time. So, I I look at it, I'm
like,
I think Fubo is the least risky it's
been
in its history. If you look at the stock
price, it's pretty much the lowest it's
ever been in its history, or around the
lowest it's ever been in its history.
But when I look at the business, what I
see is the least risky I've ever seen
Fubo in the company's entire public
history. Like, they're locked in now
with Disney, who has obviously just
massive ownership in so many channels.
And Disney has a huge vested interest in
Fubo being successful because they own
like 70%ish of the company, right? Huge
vested interest. And Disney obviously
controls so much of sports content which
is Fubo's holy grail
and they're loaded with cash and their
profitability metrics have increased in
an unbelievable way.
I don't know, you know, I just see what
I see. Okay, next up here, let's talk
some tech. Then we'll talk Palunteer and
then we're going to talk Don't go bottom
fishing for stocks. That should be
interesting.
>> Senior managing director Julian. Good to
have you.
>> Good to be here. Um, you think the
market's going to actually thrive and
and it's going to be driven by by
basically the tech trade. You're not
worried about sort of the hiccups that
we've seen recently in the AI trade.
>> Well, I Oh, shoot. I got to talk about
my SAS stocks. Oh, boy. Okay. SAS stocks
like Service Now, Adobe, you know, CRM,
all these sorts of stocks. Okay. Shoot.
Forgot those stocks are crashing, too.
It's just like on a day like today when
you see 20% downward moves, you see like
7 10% downward moves and it seems like
not that much, right? Okay. in regards
to those stocks
doesn't surprise me at all. As I spoke
about many times with these sort of
stocks, like I'm trying to pick up as
many shares I possibly can over the next
two months, right? And you've heard me
talk about that on the main channel,
this channel in regards to service now,
in regards to CRM, Adobe. I'm just
buying buying buying relentlessly right
now these stocks, right? And plan do for
the in till the end of the quarter. So
basically two months if the stocks
remain low, which they probably will
because even when they start to bounce,
like they're still going to be very
discounted, right? My plan is to
continue to buy those stocks for this
entire year, right? I do not believe, my
personal belief and what I see in the
numbers, there's no signs that these
companies have been disrupted by AI or
they're going to be disrupted by AI,
right? And AI could be a good
opportunity for these companies. And so,
no one wants to own these stocks right
now. Basically, Wall Street's thrown
them out. They're unownable clearly.
Look at the stock price moves in regards
to all these stocks. And this is without
even a stock market crash. Imagine if
the market was down 20 or 30% right now.
Imagine where these stocks would be.
And so that's fine. Their trash is my
treasure. And we'll see who's right.
Right.
That's the fun in this game. We'll see
who's right. I think I'll be right.
These are some of the best business
models in the world that they're just
throwing out. CRM, Adobe, now. Like
literally, these are some of the best
business models in the world, and
they're just throwing them out like
they're irrelevant. Okay, we'll see.
We'll I will go back to December and the
the concerns about uh debt financing for
the AI buildout started to surface and
and unequivocally the mood around tech
is as cautious as we've seen it since
any time since chat GPT was introduced
to the world and you know frankly I
never expected to be a contrarian in our
view that we think tech will continue to
lead the bull market higher. I love
being a contrarian here and you look at
a day like today, there were lots of
news items.
>> Is he Is he lying? Absolutely not.
Julian Emanuel's just being he's telling
the truth. The mood is as cautious as
certainly we've seen since probably 2022
regarding these tech stocks. Look at the
moves. Look at intuitit. Intuitit's down
another 11% today. You could be flipping
my flapjacks. I might start buying into
it stock. The the way that stock's going
down. This is insane. This is insane.
Check out this is wow into it. The move
on that stock. Look at in it. It's down
31% in the past one month. 31. This is
another one of the best business models
in the world. And it's down third. Like
they do not want any piece of any of
these stocks. Snowflake's down another
10% today. IBM's down huge. There's
there's like a stock market crash going
on in a lot of these sorts of tech
stocks, right? Incredible. Look at
Oracle's now down to 154.
Look at the move since it had that big
blowoff top after the open AI
announcement. The stock's now down 55%.
And once again, we are not in a stock
market crash. The stock market's only
what, a couple percent off of all-time
highs. Imagine if we are actually in a
damaged market right now.
They don't want to own anything.
if they don't want to own a hardwareish
kind of plays like Oracle, but they also
don't want to own SAS related plays, but
also they this is the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.
This is so dumb. I'm just going to be
honest with you. This is so dumb. Okay,
everybody's doubting Open AI and their
success, their ability to raise capital,
all those things, right? Basically
doubting AI in general, right? Because
if OpenAI was really like that much of a
gamechanging company, then no one would
be doubting like if they could raise
capital, right? But everybody's doubting
that. That's like the big doubt out
there. And so if you have anything
associated with open AI, they're like,
"Oh, we don't want to own you right now,
right?" But simultane So bas basically
they're doubting the whole AI
revolution. At the same exact time,
they're throwing out all the SAS related
companies have the best business models
in the world because they might get
disrupted by AI. Make it make sense.
Make it make sense.
Come on. Like you can't you
It's one or the other. One of the other
either AI is the biggest game changer in
history and like Nvidia and AMD are
going to a thousand, right? and uh you
know I don't know MU is going to a
thousand and like open AAI is going to
become a 345 trillion market cap and you
know so or it's like maybe things have
gotten overblown and guess what now is
going to make fortunes of money over the
next few years cuz they're not going to
be disrupted same thing with Salesforce
and same thing with Adobe go through the
whole list
>> a lot of them not so great certainly
challenging uh particularly against the
backdrop of gold and silver tanking as
well uh once more and the market traded
beautifully, which you would never have
said at 1:00 in the morning when I was
>> Oh my gosh, look at Netflix is down to
80.
Look at No,
no,
no way.
No way. Look at Netflix. This is a wild
one. On a threemon, Netflix is down 26
and a half%.
Whoa.
How much off alltime highs are we at
now? Netflix is now down. It's in a 40%
draw down from alltime highs it reached
last summer.
Wow.
Wow.
Jeez.
That's That's wild. That
maybe maybe Netflix gonna just get
disrupted by AI also like you know and
like they're just gonna everybody's just
gonna watch like AI content and Netflix
going to become irrelevant even though
they could make AI content but let's not
think about that. Uh for P20 down to 24
Netflix now. No way.
No way.
Let's run some projections on Netflix. I
mean, gosh,
this is tough. This is tough because
you're just getting into a market now
where so many stocks are starting to be
down big that it's just like, gosh,
you're starting to, and this is a
problem when you start having so many
stocks damaged out there, you start
having so many opportunities. You're
like, dude, I want to put money in this
stock. I want to put money in this. Like
honestly, I want to if it wasn't for me
buying a lot of Service Now stock right
now and Adobe and Salesforce and those
sorts of stocks, I mean, I'd be looking
at something like Netflix, you know, let
let's put a let's do a bullc case here
on Netflix of let's do a bullcase at 12%
revenue growth on average per year,
right? And let's say profit net income
increase a little bit higher. Let's say,
you know, 300 basis point change there
uh above revenue, so 15%. you know, we
can say uh at those sorts of growth
rates a 25 to 30p is extremely fair. So
30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30.
Wow,
that's kind of surprising regarding
Netflix here.
I would have expected
I would have expected the returns to
actually be better.
That's kind of surprising.
H
Let's run a more modest projection here
of 10%
and 12%.
And let's go like 23 to 28 on this guy.
28 28 28 28 28
and h that's strange.
So basically Netflix is in a situation
where they really got to grow very very
strong.
I would have expected the returns to be
better for Netflix.
It's a little surprising.
It's a little surprising. Let me look up
one thing here.
H they are supposed to have a big
increase in profitability. So maybe
those numbers could have been a little
higher, but still like maybe I could
have went with like a net income
increase of 20% on average per year or
something like that. But still like
h yeah see I probably went low with kind
of my net income and EPS expectations
cuz analysts are kind of in the 20s and
I ran like at a 15% number. So, if we
ran let let's run like a 20% number on
average per year and then see what we
get for Netflix here. I hope you guys
enjoy running numbers.
You might you might not. Okay. So, let's
do the 12% still, but let's say 20% on
average bottom line. Okay. And then
let's still keep it at a 25 to 30 PE
here. Oops. And let's see what we get
and see how that changes the equation.
My guess is 15% maybe. Yeah. Well,
almost a 15% uh midpoint here. We can
call it like 15.5%, right? Um 13 to 18%.
Still not that great.
Like I would like it's still a money
like is Netflix a money maker for if you
if you buy Netflix today, is it a money
maker? Likely over the next 3 to 5
years, yes. But it's actually not the
best opportunity out there. Certainly in
my opinion, right? there's just much
better opportunity. So that's
intriguing. Okay, let's get in a pound.
>> Revenue seen between $7.18 billion and
$7.2 billion. The uh estimate going in
had been for $6.27 billion. So quite a
beat there when it comes to the
expectations. Brent, you can see that
reflected in the shares. What do you
make of what we learned at the top of
the hour?
uh they're still crushing the numbers
and I think a world of AI that is
getting crushed in software by my
coverage universe is going straight
south. You know, Palanteers fundamentals
are are are doing extremely well. Cash
flow growth uh well above forecast. The
commercial business doing very well.
Obviously, if you look at the government
business, you can see what's going on in
our world and and the the place they're
going to be. So I think the fundamentals
are uh screening high. You obviously
have to pay a price which is it's the
single most expensive stock.
>> Mhm.
>> By a factor of two. So you know if we
were in a better tape stock would be up
a lot more. You know we're dealing with
a stock that's still 45 times revenue
>> and it's still one of the most expensive
names and we've had a a whole group
that's under massive duress because of
what is AI going to do? So they're uh
fundamentally in a great spot.
Obviously, valuation
concerns why the stock has sold off from
over $200 to mid150s, right?
>> Is because everyone's checking the
valuation and realizing it doesn't
really make a lot of sense.
>> Well, valuation being one thing. Let's
talk a little bit more about
fundamentals because we know that
Palanteer makes the lion share of its
revenue from its government contracts.
We know that there has been a push to
maybe diverse. So the interesting thing
here regarding Palanteer is is
Palanteer's growth rates are so far
exceeding what anybody anticipated,
Bulls, Bears, anybody, right? Uh that
the analysts are going to have to keep
bringing up their numbers. So like look
at current year expected revenue growth.
They're kind of at 40%. Dude, you got to
bring up that number. You got to get
more in at least a 50% range, if not 60%
range. Next year revenue growth, like
you got to bring that number up. So,
analysts are still off sides regarding
Palanteer, and that's kind of a crazy
thing to think, but they're going to
have to bring up all their numbers, and
the company's way more profitable than
anybody anticipated. You know, the rule
of 40 is now what 127. So,
the craziest thing about Palunteer is,
yeah, it looks insane. Like, look at the
trailing 12 month PE, 366. But look at
how fast they're eating up the the PE
ratios because they're increasing
profitability so rapidly. Then they get
it down to 157. Obviously 157 is still
insane compared to the market in
general. Trades at a 4p like 20 or so,
right? But the growth rates of Palanteer
are at least 10x if not 12 or 14x
what an average stock trades at. At a
157 PE if the market's trading at 20,
right? You're at like a like a 7x. We
can call it 8x. Let's call it an 8x,
right? So, but the question is can
Palanteer keep growing at these sorts of
growth rates or growth rates about to go
down to 40% 30% 20% those sorts of
things and that's where the great debate
comes in.
>> Divide that out to uh commercial
contracts as well. What are you seeing
there in terms of progress?
>> Yeah, I mean the commercial business uh
they're guiding growth of over 115%. So,
I mean there not too many companies
putting up those numbers, right? We we
talk about a 10 to
>> That makes me so happy. You know why?
My whole thesis for investing in
Palunteer years ago was all around the
commercial business. The government
business to me has never been the thing.
I'm like, "Okay, they sign a military
contract, whatever. I don't care." Like,
it's cool. Like, that's their their
business. The commercial side is always
the side of the business that for me has
been the huge opportunity. I'm like the
government business is just it's like
nothing compared to at least in my
opinion what the commercial business
like I always imagine Palanteer in the
2030s as having this commercial business
so large that it dwarfs anything in the
government business and that the
government business almost becomes like
a distraction for them right honestly I
think that could be the way that the
story goes where you know if we fast
forward to the 2030s the government
business will be like and honestly the
government business the other thing
about the government business for
Palanteer is, and I don't know if they
could really ever split it off, even
though I wouldn't mind. The government
business is what gives Palunteer bad
rep, right? That that like people don't
like the surveillance related stuff that
Palunteer is involved with, right? And
the data tracking and all that stuff.
Like the government business is 100% of
what gives Palunteer like a bad name,
right? But it also does a lot for
branding because it's like okay if the
US military, if the US army, if you know
um all these advanced agencies and the
government, if they feel like Palanteer
is such a great product that they've got
to use it, why shouldn't you as a
Fortune 500 company? So it's kind of
like uh
it's good and it's bad, right? Yeah. The
bad is you get a a lot of bad publicity.
I mean, they got like the $30 million
contract if I recall with ICE. Like, and
we know how much hate ICE is getting
right now. Like,
you know, it's just like all that's just
a big cloud over the company.
But shoot, man. Like, you know, it means
they got a great product. Like, the
government's not just going to use
Palunteer to just use Palanteer.
>> 15% growth rate for a lot of the large
cap names and they're pushing 115. So,
uh, you know, it's not even not even
really comparable.
>> No. Uh, and I think this goes back to
every boardroom
globally is thinking about AI. They're
thinking about how do I implement this?
Whether I'm healthcare or I'm I I'm a
retail company, whatever your business
you're in, you're thinking about this
first and foremost in the boardroom. And
they've done a great job. You have
companies, commercial companies now,
highlighting them on earnings calls
saying that they the product is is is
taking costs out of the supply chain.
They're putting people into hospitals um
faster and and getting the right right
health care. Um so I mean they're
solving problems as they say that no one
else can solve. And I think they really
solved the puzzle which was it was the
Tesla problem of the beginning. You know
the car can only
>> uh shuttle around doctors, lawyers and
people that have 30 years of experience
because they're they're so expensive.
And what they figured out is how to
bring the software more to the mass
market to more commercial companies. and
they they have done a really good job of
solving this. And so um putting up 115%
growth is pretty incredible. And I think
it shows they've overcome the problem
which was you know where for a very few
select people they're now showing with
these numbers that
>> they they can address a bigger portion
of the commercial market. Uh which is
which which is exceptional. And I I'd
say that the companies that we talk to
in our industry that love data are all
acknowledging how well Palanteer is
doing. And so if you talk to Oracle, you
talk to many others, even Mark Benning
is talking about, you know, the the
model of for deployed engineers,
um that tells you a lot uh about, you
know, the fundamentals and how they run
and the success they're having. And so I
think that's um when you're when others
in the industry are trying to emulate
you, you know, you're doing something
right. When you're put up 115%
commercial growth, you're you're doing
you're doing something right.
>> Yeah. No, no doubt about it. I am
curious though, Brent, though, if you
think this is a company that can
actually
>> So, one thing I'll I'll
>> caution Palunteer investors on cuz I did
see this posted like on X and different
places yesterday. Um even in the private
stock group, some folks were talking
about this, right? And I think this
frame of thought is not the best frame
of thought regarding Palanteer. It's
very important. Okay, listen. Some
people were talking about
Palunteer only has like a thousand
customers, right? Or a small amount of
customers, like roughly around a
thousand, right? And they were talking
about like Salesforce has like 100,000
plus customers or this company has, you
know, 8,000 customers and things like
that, right? You got to understand like
Palanteer, their business model is
geared toward big ticket customers,
people that can spend millions of
dollars a year on Palunteer, right? Or
tens of millions of dollars a year on
Palunteer's products or hundred million
dollars plus a year. Who can afford to
spend millions of dollars a year or tens
of millions or whatever, right, on
Palanteer's
offerings? Who can do that?
very few companies only the big dogs the
biggest the big right so you look at
something like a Salesforce I'm a
Salesforce customer with my small
businesses right I can't afford
Palanteer's products so I can never be a
Palunteer customer unless I you know
thousandx becomes like some massive
business that like is bringing in
hundreds of millions of dollars a year
then I could use Palunteer I guess but
like Salesforce can have a customer like
me that runs small businesses right and
if you're a small business owner out
there. You might use one of Salesforce
offerings if not multiple Salesforce
offerings. So, it's a very different you
like Salesforce can be like you could be
a small business and use at least one of
Salesforce offerings if not multiple of
them, right? You could be a midsize
business or you could be a gigantic
corporation, use Salesforce
and their different offerings, right?
They got a lot of different products at
that company. Somebody like a Palanteer
like no, if you're a mid-size business
even, you're probably not using
Palanteer either. You got to you got to
likely be a company doing hundreds of
millions if not billions of dollars of
revenue a year and you got to be in a
situation where you likely have
thousands of employees. If you got 20
employees, you're probably not using
Palunteer, okay? It's just no, it's not
realistic, right? So, that's the one
thing I want to caution folks on is like
customer count and people thinking like,
oh, Palunteer could be as huge as
Salesforce. They have to fundamentally
change their business model and product
pricing and all those sorts of things.
And you can't really do that cuz let's
say Palanteer is like, "Oh, we're going
to give away our our capabilities to
small businesses for, you know, 10% of
the price." You think they're going to
do that? Of course not. Cuz then their
big customers are going to say, "Wait a
minute. You're giving, you know, the
small competitor of ours, you know, a
90% discount, which versus what you
charge us." Like, obviously that's going
to cause huge problems. So, you know,
Palanteer is kind of really stuck at the
high end, which is a great place to be,
but don't expect them to ever have
100,000 plus customers. Like, it's
possible, but it's not very realistic.
It would take a full fundamental change
of the business model, pricing, and all
those sorts
>> to grow into that valuation a little
bit. I mean, we know on the government
side, obviously, uh the ties to the uh
current administration have helped a
lot. It's good and encouraging to see
them expanding a little bit more in the
commercial side, but again, I mean, I
know for a lot of investors,
fundamentals don't seem to matter
anymore, but when I look at these
multiples, I just think when did they
grow into that?
>> Yeah. I mean, that's that's the push
back. I mean, again, I I think we try to
rate it in two different parts of our
rating. It's a it's a buy fundamentally.
It's a strong sell if you had a strong
sell on the on the multiple because if
you look at the next tier down, you have
companies like Crowd Strike and some
really good companies that are trading,
you know, sub 20 times revenue and this
is still 45 times revenue. And so, you
know,
>> in all due respect, what's CrowdStrike
uh revenue growth compared to Palunteer?
>> $200 plus. We were just like, this
doesn't make any sense on a valuation
basis. And so, you know, you you kind of
have to basically say, you know, what's
the available TAM? Can they grow under
they can they sustain these rates? Can
they sustain the cash flow? And what
they're proving is they they can do a
lot of these things. It's just that's
going to take forever for the multiple
to come in. And so, we saw this with
Snowflake. We saw this with many other
names we cover. It can just take a long
time to grow in. So what we've said is
like you can buy Meta at mid 20 times
earnings but you got to pay 50 times
revenue for Palanteer and I much rather
buy Meta you know like and Meta stocks
up and Palanteer stock is down for the
year.
>> So I think our our our trade-off is like
everything has a price and we look at
both fundamentals and valuation.
evaluation has just been impossible for
many of the long onies that we cover on
this institution community to to
stomach. And
>> listen, you know, I know a man like
that's probably going to get hate,
right? Like I'm sure he's probably going
to get hate, right? Um like, can we go
down?
So, I bought Palunteer below $10. I
learned listening to these types of
analysts won't help you make money. Uh
never made any sense for analyst day
one. It's only a matter of time when
it's one trillion. Uh oh no, not this
guy. So, you know, obviously he's
getting a lot of hate. Listen, man, as
somebody that's been in the market 17
years, somebody that's a Palanteer
shareholder, right? And that's somebody
that made insane money on Palunteer and
took so many profits over the past year
in the stock. It's ridiculous, right? I
think his take is very balanced. He's
telling you the fundamentals of the
company are as good as it gets, right?
He's talking about the great growth
rates and those things. He's talking
about it's going to take a long time to
grow into that. And
as a mature investor, you got to be able
to take a balance take like that and be
like that's fair because it is fair.
It's just not it's not like you know if
you know anything about running
valuations on stocks you can look at
that and be like yeah if they keep up
these sorts of growth rates or anything
around here then you can say valuation
might be cheap. Like let's say they keep
growing a 70 60% type revenue growth and
having that earnings per share you know
fly
then you could say well actually you
could make a case that maybe this
stock's a little cheap right now and
it's going to be a great returner over
the next several years right and be able
to command continue to command 100 plus
FordP you can make a strong case for
that right however if those growth rates
start to decelerate and we go down to
60% revenue growth 50 40 you'll run into
big valuation problems with the stock
Right. And so which would then leave it
to be stuck. Like I've talked about, you
know, Palanteer, I kept talking about
that last year. Palanteer just being
stuck between 125 and kind of the 200ish
range, right? People are feeling really
bullish about Palanteer pushes up to
that 200 range. People are feeling
really bearish. Goes down to 125. And I
talked about it just kind of being stuck
for years in that place, right? So far
it's looking true, but we'll see. Maybe
it doesn't. The big thing is if they
could sustain these sorts of growth
rates,
shoot, like, you know, there's there's
potential stock go 250, 300, 350, right?
But I have a lot of doubts about that,
right? These numbers have been insane.
And uh they're going to have to comp
these numbers uh that they're going to
put up in 26. They're going to have to
comp these in 27. And dude, that's going
to be brutal. Brutal to comp these
numbers in in 27, right? because you got
to keep showing like this insane revenue
growth off of a much bigger base.
Difficult. Don't go bottom fishing for
stocks as hard.
>> So, what do you do in the meantime
during this financial eternity where
suddenly there's a question about
whether Main Street gets uh some of the
stimulus and frankly Wall Street is
struggling with questions around
artificial intelligence,
>> right? So, not to be too wonky, but one
of the things we say we want you to go
up in quality. So, higher quality
companies, good balance sheets, um good
stewards of capital. In addition to
that, we don't think it's the time to go
bottom fishing, right? Uh the chart
can't look bad. Chart has to look good.
Um because a lot,
>> by the way, I I'll say this regarding um
you know, because AMD earnings will come
out. I'm sure I'll cover those tonight.
Uh this is actually a great situation
for AMD to go into the earnings on a big
down day like today. The last thing
you'd want is let's say AMD comes out,
reports great numbers, great guidance,
and tomorrow's a huge down day for the
market, right? Like today was, that's a
that's a tough setup. So, if you're
bullish on AMD, it's actually better
that today's a big down day. Right now,
if AMD numbers aren't good, like it
doesn't matter. The stock's still going
down. But let's say they come out and
blow out revenue expectations, earnest
per share expectations, and guidance and
the conference calls a banger. The best
situation is you had the big red day
today cuz then tomorrow AMD can fly,
right? And then catch a lot of momentum,
catch a lot of attention. Everybody's in
the grandma's talking about AMD. So
yeah, I'll say the setup for AMD is
good. But they still got to come in and
kill it. If they come in and kill it,
this setup is actually like literally
perfection for AMD. And you can see that
stock go $299. Imagine AMD $299 a share.
>> These companies with positive price
momentum, right? They do have better
fundamentals. So we want to marry higher
quality companies with companies that
the market's already rewarding
no matter what sector you're looking at.
>> Is big tech still high quality at these
valuations? I think so. And I think one
of the really interesting things is
yesterday Oracle had a bond issuance. I
think they had a convert issuance that
went quite well, right? There's been a
lot of um concern about hypers scale or
hyperscaler funding and I think that put
a lot of concerns and a lot of fears to
rest.
>> Are you hopeful for the numbers we get
from Alphabet and Amazon that this just
continues? I
>> I think the numbers in earning season
have been pretty good. The one thing I'm
not seeing and and you still have a lot
of idiosyncratic risk, right? But the
one thing I'm not seeing is I'm not
seeing this acceleration, right? And if
you need an acceleration in the economy,
you need an acceleration in earnings to
really go down to that secondary and
tertiary bucket.
>> One thing we talked about is how much
the tech trade has just changed.
>> Hardware versus software within Mac 7 as
well. I'm not sure we can even talk
about Mac 7 as a group of stocks. It
just looks so different from Meta to
Microsoft. And Apple has no place in
that group.
>> I I don't know if it has has no place,
but you're right. The phrase that I
>> I'm sorry, I got distracted. I got the
windows open here in this front room and
uh
this kid is like riding an electric
scooter around. Like when I say kid, I'm
talking like young teenager, but he's I
don't know if it's he or her actually.
It's hard to tell, but they're trying to
do jumps on this electric scooter. I
don't think you can really do jumps on
an electric scooter. I think they're too
heavy, but I don't know.
>> Anyways,
>> hey, and a phrase a lot of people use
coming, it's a stock pickers market. uh
every year it's always a stock picker
market. I I don't I don't understand
that phrase stock market. I I think it
is applicable here. You do have because
idiosyncratic risk is getting bigger.
You're later in the cycle. Um because
the economy is not accelerating because
earnings are not accelerating. You
really need a good idiosyncratic or
stock specific.
>> Can I just pick up on that phrase later
in the cycle? Yeah.
>> Late cycle or later in the cycle?
>> I think it's later in the cycle. Um so
credit spreads um and you probably seen
this um hit um hit a low we haven't seen
since Astro watch jeans were in favor
right since 1997. Um the amount of
issuance that we're seeing is is really
rather significant. Um these
>> there's such a big debate on if we're
late cycle like I I hear people time and
time again but this isn't new. I feel
like this has been for the last couple
years. People talking about we're late
cycle, we're later cycle, right? these
sorts of things.
I get that and you can make a strong
case that we're late cycle, later cycle,
right? Bad things in the economy are
coming or something like that. But
listen, I can make a very strong case
that almost no one makes right now that
we're early cycle, right?
And so I I think you shouldn't just
assume we're late cycle and like the
crash is coming or something like that.
Like you could make a strong argument
that we're early cycle. how
we basically went through a massive
recession that you know I would call
significant but no one looked at because
people still had jobs right it wasn't a
jobless recession like we had in the
great financial crisis where you had
unemployment rate go to 10% you know or
so right this was a recession where
people kept their jobs but got
absolutely obliterated by inflation and
we all know that right and so people's
spending power got wrecked, right? And
things started to kind of get better, I
would say, over the past year and a half
or so regarding, you know, obviously
inflation rates coming down dramatically
and then people's spending ability going
up, right? And then interest rates
starting to come down, although, you
know, hopefully they come down a lot
further. But I mean, you could look at
something like, let's say, for instance,
housing activity, right? Housing
activity is among the worst in modern
times. like it's been the among the
worst in modern times for a while,
right? That's something you usually only
see when you usually only see something
like that when you're going through it,
right? And um you're in bad times. And
so there's a a strong argument to be
made if housing picks up over the next
few years, you're in an early stage of a
economic expansion cycle, right? Just
something to keep in mind. If, let's
say, taxes favor people as well, right?
And they're not getting taxed quite as
much and the big beautiful bill really
comes through and helps people out some,
there you go again, right? You can make
an argument that we're early cycle,
especially if inflation remains low.
Let's say CPI remains under 3%.
I mean, you know, everybody talks about
we're late cycle, we're later cycle, and
like I get it. Like you can make a
strong argument, but you got to be able
to understand there's an argument to be
made that we're early cycle.
>> The things you see later in the cycle,
right? Do I think the cycle will
continue? I do think the cycle will
continue because I do think there's a
lot of accommodation in the system and I
don't think the uh monetary policy
accommodation is done.
>> So what kind of returns are you
expecting this year? We've seen some
projections for 7,800 8,000. This idea
that you can have AI continue to fuel
this even amid some of the wobbles that
we've seen recently. Do you think that
that's fair or do you think that it's
going to be more of a churn to year end?
I
>> I think so. Our expectations for high
single digits at 74 7450, right? Um last
year were much more aggressive. And what
we think is by the end of the year,
you're going to start looking to 27 and
now you're going to start looking at a
situation where it's beginning to
decelerate. That said, with so much
accommodation on the table and with the
Trump administration pushing things in
front of midterms, we could have a
little bit of a meltup or a pop um
summertime, um fall, I think.
>> So, this is sort of the the bipolar
aspect of a lot of the conversations we
have. Some people say because of the
midterm elections, you're going to get a
meltup. Other people say you could get a
meltdown in certain names. I'm thinking
in particular of artificial intelligence
related energy types of projects
especially with the affordability crisis
and how much you could crack down.
There's been questions around the banks
trade and what we've seen there. How do
you pair these two ideas?
>> So what we what we're saying is I think
in the first half right you're going to
have bounce of risk aversion. We've
already seen a couple bouts of risk
aversion not not excessive. That's going
to continue. I think people are really
really under coming into the year
underappreciate the macro and and some
of the macro concerns. Underlying
fundamentals are still good. We would
buy any sort of 5% 5% plus pullback. I
think we do get some of that right
because expectations are so high but at
the end of the day we think equities do
go higher later in the year and there is
a possibility for a sharp pop higher
sometime maybe in the summertime maybe
in the fall.
>> Yeah. uh shake out all the retail
investors, shake them out first and then
uh up up and away we go, right? Uh
that's usually how it works. Everybody
gets frustrated by the market. Stock
market's a scam and uh they sell out all
their stocks after they got wrecked and
then uh then right after that that's
when the market absolutely rockets
higher. It was like 2022, right? People
got wrecked in 2022 and uh left the
market sold stocks like Palunteer at 67
89 $10, right? ah stock stocks all these
stock stock you know uh meta went down
to $88 from 300 something right and um
you know just relentless selling and
people leave the market and
you know the rest is history right I
mean AMD in that crash went down to 50
something dollars Nvidia is up over a
th000% since that those lows right and
you had a lot of retail investors leave
the market and say the market's a scam
like you know and it's
when you get that sort of capitulation,
that's usually when uh things reverse
higher and you know, you just go to the
moon and then those people that weren't
in just turn into perma bears maybe,
right? Um okay, we're in earning season.
We got a lot going on. I'll probably
cover AM I'll for sure cover AMD
