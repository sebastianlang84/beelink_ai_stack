We're going to dive into four investment
legends and the portfolios that they
hold right now. And we'll go ahead and
roll them all back five years. That way,
it's going to be the same market and the
same timeline where one of these
portfolios would have turned $10,000
invested 5 years ago into $65,000, and
another would have been $19,000, but a
third barely even doubles their money.
This is four completely different
futures, and I'm going to show you which
style wins, which one loses, and why it
matters to every dollar you invest.
Let's talk about how much these legends
actually agree on because the answer is
shockingly very little. Out of more than
120 combined holdings, the four of them
only share three different stocks.
That's about a 2.5% overlap rate. 97% of
their portfolios don't even touch one
another. However, those three shared
names tell you exactly what the smartest
investors on Earth quietly agree on. The
first overlap is Alphabet or Google.
It's owned by Buffett, Pelosi, and Aman.

>> three completely different styles and
they're all pointing to the same core
idea. The second overlap is Amazon again
held by Buffett, Pelosi and Aman.
Different strategies but the same
conclusion. AWS logistics and consumer
scale are infrastructure right now and
they're not optional bets. And the third
and most obvious overlap is Apple. It's
direct for Buffett and Pelosi and it's
indirect for Gates through his nearly
30% position in Birkshshire Hathaway. So
once again, three of the four legends
end up in the same place. The most
profitable consumer engine on earth. So
out of everything that these four
legends hold, the entire overlap just
comes down to three pillars. Happens to
be search, it's cloud, and one of the
hottest brands of all time. So here's
what this should be telling us. If you
want to build a portfolio that every
legend would respect, regardless of your
style, then you probably want to start
with these
