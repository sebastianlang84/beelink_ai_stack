# Stocks: Palantir (PLTR) Q4 2025 Earnings Analysis

## Executive Summary
- Palantir reported "video game numbers" with 70% revenue growth and a Rule of 40 score reaching 140.
- US Commercial revenue is the primary driver, growing at 140% year-over-year.
- Net income increased 7.5x in a single year, rising from $79M to $608M.
- Management guided for 60% revenue growth for the full year 2026.
- The stock is positioned as a "foundation layer" monopoly, agnostic to which AI models or hardware providers win the "AI wars."

## Key Points
- **Earnings Beat vs. Sentiment**: The stock dropped 10-12% heading into earnings, pricing in a negative scenario and lowering the threshold for a post-earnings rally ("the sentiment essentially has already priced in the worst possible outcome").
- **Rule of 40 Excellence**: The company achieved a Rule of 40 score of 130-140, up from 81 just twelve months ago ("literally three times higher than the best score you could hope for").
- **US Commercial Dominance**: US commercial growth hit 140%, driven by the "only way to apply AI into your business with safety features, regulation, and efficiency."
- **Government Sector Potential**: Government growth is at 60%, but viewed as misunderstood; it is expected to rival commercial growth due to an "AI arms race" in defense.
- **Valuation Comparison**: Palantir's $350B market cap is compared to other tech monopolies (Avg. $3.8T), suggesting it is "10x cheaper than the average monopolistic tech company."
- **Agnostic AI Play**: Palantir acts as the operating system/foundation layer, making it indifferent to which LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic) or GPU (Nvidia, AMD) dominates.

## Numbers
- metric: Revenue Growth | value: 70 | unit: % | context: Year-over-year quarterly growth
- metric: Rule of 40 | value: 140 | unit: score | context: Combined revenue growth and FCF margin
- metric: Net Income | value: 608 | unit: million USD | context: Increased from $79M in the prior year

## Opportunities
- **Government Scaling**: Potential for 10x growth in the government sector over 4 years due to long-duration, sticky defense contracts.
- **Capacity Constraints**: The company is currently "oversubscribed" and refusing people at the door, suggesting massive untapped demand.
- **Operating Leverage**: A super-scalable business model where costs are rising at a "minuscule" rate compared to sales.

## Risks
- **High PE Ratio**: Acknowledged as "very high" by traditional metrics, though the speaker argues it is irrelevant for high-growth tech outliers.
- **Sentiment Volatility**: Recent 12% pre-earnings drop highlights sensitivity to social media and market noise.

## Unknowns
- Specific breakdown of the "130 or 140" Rule of 40 score (depends on the analyst/calculation).
- Exact timeline for the 10x government sector expansion.

## IST-Stand
Palantir is currently in a hyper-growth phase with 80% gross margins and $5B in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPOs). It has transitioned from a Rule of 40 score of 45 to 140 in a few years, establishing itself as a critical infrastructure layer for AI implementation in both commercial and defense sectors.
