## Summary
Palantir (PLTR) reported exceptionally strong quarterly results, characterized by 70% revenue growth and an 83% increase in gross profit. Analyst Jeremy Lefebvre awarded the income statement an "A++" grade, noting that the company's financial efficiency is scaling rapidly as revenue growth far outpaces cost increases. Despite broader market fears of a crash and volatility in assets like Bitcoin, Palantir's guidance and fundamentals remain highly robust.

## Key Points & Insights
- **Financial Performance:** Palantir's revenue growth is highly efficient; while revenue grew 70%, the cost of revenue only increased by 24%.
- **Historical Context:** The stock previously neared "the Goolog" (levels under $5) a few years ago before this fundamental turnaround.
- **Valuation Debate:** While financial statements are considered among the "greatest in the world," arguments remain regarding the stock's valuation and future growth rates.
- **Market Sentiment:** Lefebvre dismisses social media predictions of an immediate market crash, noting significant gains in his public accounts despite "devastating day" forecasts on X (Twitter).
- **Macro Correlations:** There is a noted potential correlation between risk assets like Bitcoin (with forecasts suggesting a drop to $40,000) and the growth stock sector.
- **AI Industry Dynamics:** Mention of shifting relations between Nvidia and OpenAI, with Nvidia leadership possibly showing decreased interest in investing in OpenAI.

## Numbers
- **Revenue Growth:** 70%
- **Gross Profit (Current):** Just under $1.2 billion ("Gross profit was just under $1.2 billion billion dollars from 652")
- **Gross Profit Growth:** 83%
- **Cost of Revenue Increase:** 24%
- **Jeremy’s Cost Basis:** $7.35 and $7.43 per share.

## Chances

## Risks
- **Valuation:** High premiums on the stock price relative to earnings may lead to continued debate or volatility.
- **Risk Asset Correlation:** If Bitcoin falls significantly, it may drag down growth stocks like Palantir.
