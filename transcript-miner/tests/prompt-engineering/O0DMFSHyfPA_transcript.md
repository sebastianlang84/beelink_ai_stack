Hello everybody and welcome to my top
stock to buy in the month of February.
Now this goes along with my asymmetric
portfolio and the stocks that I actually
sent out the email what I was buying for
the month of February yesterday that
went to all my premium subscribers on
the newsletter. So if you want to be
part of that there's a link on the
screen and the link in the show notes.
What is the top stock to buy in the
market today? IDV 60% plus drop in
shares of HIMS and hers is absolutely
insane given the momentum the company
has the platform that it's building in
healthcare. The fact that we know that
labs have been launched. We know that
long longevity products like peptides
are coming in 2026. There are so many
tails tailwinds behind this business.
And the real story about him and hers is
about disruption. It's not about doing
the same thing that everybody else is
doing. I'm going to explain exactly what
I mean by that in this video by
comparing ROW, which is getting a lot of
attention right now for having some of
the weight loss medications, the pill
forms that just came out for GLP1s. Hims
and Hers doesn't have access to those,
but I'm going to show exactly why the
Hims and Hers is still a much better
deal for users and and is more
disruptive to the healthcare industry
long term. If you want more from me,
check out my newsletter, Asymmetric
Investing. There's a link on the screen
and a link in the show notes. That's
where I'm building my asymmetric
portfolio. I buy stocks once a month,
track that performance over a long
period of time. You can see from this
chart here, that portfolio is beating
the market by a sound margin despite the
fact that it's been a rough couple of
months because stocks like him and hers
have had a huge pullback. But longterm,
we want to just be accumulating stocks
like this at these kind of attractive
prices. I also want to thank this video

Absolutely the best platform that I've
ever used for doing fundamental research
on stocks. It's got all the information
you need right in one place and you can
make phenomenal charts when you want to
communicate an investment thesis with
somebody else. So, let's dig right into
him and hers. Just to give some headline
numbers here, $6.8 billion market cap.
So, we're talking about a business
that's trying to disrupt a $400 billion
pharmaceutical industry. That's just the
pharmaceutical piece of things. That's
not other pieces of the healthcare
industry. So the upside potential is
obviously huge for him and hers if they
get the business model right. Enterprise
value to sales 3.3. That's pretty cheap
for a company that has a 71%
growth rate over the past 3 years. 76%
growth rate over the past 5 years. I'm
not predicting that that's going to be
the growth rate over the next 5 years.
But even if a company is growing 20 25%
that's how you actually get 10x returns.
I went back and looked at a lot of the
companies that have done 10x returns
over the last decade. Their growth rates
are typically between 20 and 25%.
Companies typically can't grow 30 plus%
for that long period of time because the
numbers just get so big. Hims and Hers
still has a ton of growth runway ahead.
I also love some of the operating
trends. So, what we've got here is this
kind of light tan column is total
revenue. So you can see total revenue
growing at that 70 plus% rate even over
the past year despite the fact that
there's a lot of complaints about him
and hers growth rate slowing. Yeah, it's
slowing to a 78% growth rate over the
past 12 months. That'll probably be a
little bit lower than that uh in the
fourth quarter and in the first quarter,
but I'll talk about what that future
looks like in just a second. And then
we've also got improving operating
margins. So they're now a profitable
company. They're sustainable. They
actually raised about a billion dollars
last year to invest more in the tools
that they need to become that disruptive
force. Things like artificial
intelligence, think like things like
acquiring suppliers. So I think longterm
when you're building that story about
what does this company look like long
term, this is the disruptive story. But
I want to use GLP1s as an example of how
hims and hers is thinking about things
differently. And the thing I want you to
think about is insurance. So typically
in healthcare in the US in particular,
everybody has to be covered by
insurance. And so everybody wants things
to be covered by their insurance that
they pay for. Now the problem with that
is even if you're covered by insurance,
a lot of your initial spending falls
under your deductible. So you may have a
$5,000 deductible. You may have a
$10,000 deductible. Things like weight
loss treatments are typically not
covered by insurance. They may go
towards that deductible, but if you're
going to spend $5,000 a year on a weight
loss treatment, you're going to probably
pay for that out of pocket, even if it's
covered by insurance, as they would say.
So let's just look at how Hims and Hers
is treating things differently because
management has talked about this over
and over. They are living outside of the
insurance ecosystem because it brings in
a whole bunch of overhead and costs that
they just simply don't want to deal
with. So if you're going to disrupt the
status quo, you have to do things
differently. They are operating their
build business. They're building their
entire business outside of insurance
because that just makes everything more
expensive. So let's show exactly how
that works. This is the HIMS site. So,
where you have a bunch of options for
weight loss treatments, and you can go
down here and you can go to what some of
their options are. So, you got kind of
the branded options, $2,000 a month or
so, and then you can go to things like
compounded GLP ones, starting at $200 a
month for a six-month plan. Oral
medications, $69 a month for a 10-month
plan. Now, with his and hers, that's all
you pay. There's no membership fee.
There's no other costs involved. This
gets you access to their 247
consultations on the app. They'll help
you track your weight, all kinds of
things that come with this monthly plan
that you typically pay for kind of ahead
of time. If you're doing a six-month
plan, this is going to be $1,200
upfront. That's the way that that works.
Row, which is getting a lot of attention
because they have the GLP1 pills as an
option. So much more attractive than
sticking a needle in yourself once a
week or even sometimes more often that
than that. They have gotten a lot of
attention recently for that product
launch, but look at the way that their
business model works. So, they actually
do take insurance, dedicated insurance
concierge. You can see over here,
there's a lot of information on these
pages about how they work with
insurance. But look at the added costs.
Your membership is going to be $45 a
month for the first month. Ongoing is
$145
per month. Every month, $145. And that
doesn't even get you anything. After you
pay that $145 a month, then you could
potentially pay $150 a month or $200 to
$300 after an initial period for
something like the WGOI pill. So the
WGOI pill, we're talking about $350 to
$450
per month to get access to that pill
through row. Through him and hers,
you're talking about a fraction of that
price. And how can they do that? The
reason that they can do that is they
don't have to spend all this time and
energy thinking about insurance. A huge
part of the RO website is talking about,
hey, we handle the insurance stuff for
you. There's costs that go into that.
There's real manpower that goes into
that and that's why you pay this price
for ongoing support for your membership
to a company like Row. So again, you go
back to Hims and Hers and this is their
products that they have out right now.
Weight loss, ED, hair loss, and then
testosterone.
These are products that don't come with
a membership fee. At least that's not an
option yet. These are not products that
take a membership fee. These are not
products that are offered through
insurance. But that means that they
don't have to pay for that membership
fee. That's the cost of accepting
insurance is the entire ecosystem
becomes more expensive. This is again
fundamentally why him and hers is
building a disruptive product and
something like row is just slotting into
the existing ecosystem. When you're
looking at companies that have 10x 100x
potential, you want to be in a
disruptive position. You don't want to
be just slotting in doing the same thing
that everybody else can do. So, what
else is disruptive about him and hers?
The lab testing is, I think, something
that is really going to be foundational
for their growth in the future. This is
something that I did late in 2025 when
this first came out. I did their
advanced lab testing, get about a 100
different biomarkers. Those results
started coming in hours after I took my
initial test. So, now I have a baseline.
I'm going to get tested again. I'll do
the labs again in 6 months. We'll see
how my health has changed. They also
offer a bunch of different options to
help improve some of your biomarkers.
So, I think what this is ultimately
going to do is it's going to start
creating an ecosystem where him and hers
is going to be basically your medical
records on an ongoing basis. So, what do
your labs look like? If you have
something like a digital scale, it can
import that information from your
digital scale. I'm wearing a Garmin
watch could incre It could upload my
heart rate, how I'm sleeping every
night. Again, you're building a healthc
care ecosystem and all the tools and
products that go along with that. And
the labs are a big piece of that. The
thing that they can do with labs is
they're starting to lay the foundations
for some of these next generation
products. And I'm talking about
peptides. Peptides is something that we
know is coming from Hims and Hers. They
acquired a peptide facility in 2025. So,
they're bringing a lot of that
manufacturing inhouse. A lot of the
peptide market currently is in kind of a
gray market, so you don't know exactly
what you're getting. So, they're going
to be one of the first manufacturers at
scale that's actually going to bring
these products to market. We don't know
exactly which products they're going to
bring to market, but when they do,
they're going to have the lab
infrastructure. They're going to have
the care infrastructure, the artificial
intelligence tools to educate consumers.
All of this is going to be a gamecher
for him and hers long term. Again,
they're building a healthcare ecosystem
outside of traditional insurance. That's
what's so important to understand about
him and hers. And then if we go back to
the financials, the proof is in the
pudding. There's concern right now that
the growth rate for him and hers is
slowing. And it is coming down just a
little bit. Let me show this. On a
quarterly basis, you can see that the
growth rate, oh no, down to 50% in the
most recent quarter. Yes, this growth
rate is going to come down a little bit.
You have crazy comps even going back to
the fourth quarter of 2024. So look at
March 2025. That was the last quarter
that they had GLP1s on shortage. So they
were able to sell a little bit more at
scale. That's going to be a really tough
tough comp for the first quarter of
2026. But the important metrics are all
trending higher for so the blue here is
monthly online revenue per average
subscriber. So how much is each
subscriber spending each month? This is
going to be a little bit volatile like I
said because of the impact of GLP1's
spending now about $80 per month. The
number of subscribers continues to
increase. We are now at about 2.5
million subscribers. So what does this
business look like when it gets to even
more scale? and we have 10 million
subscribers, maybe 15, 20 million
subscribers, and they're getting their
labs done on on an ongoing basis, and
now hims and hers has their medical
records, has their entire history, how
their health health has improved or
maybe deteriorated over time. They can
start offering early screenings for
things that you may be at high risk for.
Again, all of these things are in the
future, but this is what you have to
think about as an investor is not what
does his and hers look like today. What
does next quarter going to look like?
It's what does the next 5 years look
like? What does the next 10 years look
like? And the fact that his and hers is
building outside of the traditional
healthcare ecosystem. The fact that
pharmaceutical companies see them as
such a threat. The fact that they're
advancing in labs, they're building
artificial intelligence tools. All of
this is great news for investors. And
you're getting this at a steal of a
price today. I think look at the
enterprise value to sales. This is one I
stick to because this doesn't include
profitability, but this is just 3.3.
Let's look at some other high growth
comp. Palanteer trades for 88 times
sales. So this is about 40 times higher
than Hims and Hers today. Tesla is a
manufacturing company. They trade for
almost 17 times sales. So more than five
times higher than where Hims and Hers is
trading today. The three things that you
want in any investment that has the
potential for asymmetric returns is
revenue growth, margin expansion, and
the opportunity for multiple expansion.
So enterprise value to sales, price to
earnings multiple. We want to buy those
at reasonable multiples so that those
multiples can go up as the company
grows. Hims and Hurst has all three of
those things in spades. That's why I'm
adding more in February and this is one
of the top stocks that I'm holding in
the asymmetric portfolio. Hims and Hurst
has been a detriment to that portfolio
over the past few months. The stock has
come down, but long-term I think this is
going to be a phenomenal buying
opportunity. 2026, I think, is going to
be a year where we're going to see a lot
of progress from him and hers and this
disruption is going to continue from the
company. But let me know what you think
about him and her stock. Leave your
