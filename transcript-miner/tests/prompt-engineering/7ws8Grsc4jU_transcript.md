For years, Japan has been considered as
the epicenter of global sovereign debt
risk. This has just changed. The
currency and debt risk that sat in Japan
has now moved to the United States. We
are seeing this reflected on the US
dollar index that is now breaking a
structural uptrend that has been in
place since 2011. The playbook that
we've been talking about for months now
is playing out as we're seeing the
biggest coordinated policy shift since
the Plaza Accord in 1985. Japan's $10.1
trillion debt pile is the third largest
in the world when measured in US
dollars, but it's the largest in the
world when adjusted for GDP, making it
an ideal candidate as a potential
trigger for the destabilization of the
global debt fabric. As you've probably
seen from the headlines, Japan's bond
market is in complete collapse. We can
see that by looking at their 10-year
Treasury bond yield that has surged to
the highest levels in over 20 years
along with their 30-year bond yields and
their 40-year bond yields. The bond
panic started in the years after the
pandemic as inflation in Japan picked
up. But it's really accelerated in the
recent months as the Japanese government
has recently approved the largest
stimulus package since the pandemic,
including significant tax breaks that
would widen the government's deficit and
put further upwards pressure on
inflation. In response, the bond market
panicked. Japanese bond yields are
seeing the same level of volatility that
was seen on Greek bonds in 2011.
Needless to say that this is the way
bond investors say they're not happy
with how the country is handling its
finances and that they're losing
confidence in the ability for these
bonds to act as a store of value. Now,
typically when government bond yields
spike uncontrollably like this, a
country in this situation has two
options. Either they default on the debt
and go through a period of debt
restructuring. This is the option that
Greece was forced to choose by the
European Central Bank in 2011, for
example. The second option is
essentially money printing. The central
bank, in this case, the Bank of Japan,
prints money to buy their own government
bonds, and this can cap bond yields,
preventing them to spike further,
regardless of where private bond
investors believe bond yields should be.
Long story short, option number two is
the financial equivalent to sticking the
middle finger up at anybody who holds
Japanese bonds. And Japan is already
showing clear signs that it will choose
this option with rumors of the Bank of
Japan beginning to buy bonds in order to
cap bond yields. Now, as you can
imagine, there's no such thing as a free
lunch and this does have its
consequences. What typically happens in
this situation is that the local
currency depreciates significantly
because all of this makes it very
unattractive to hold. That should mean
that the Japanese yen should weaken
against the US dollar and so strengthen
the dollar status. But that is where the
US comes in because the US has its own
plans regarding what role they want the
US dollar to play. This is a core part
of our investment strategy. By the way,
if you're serious about taking advantage
of these trends, we highlight how we are
positioning for all of this in our 2026
report that you can watch for free in
the description below. Now, as we
mentioned earlier, all of Japan's
currency and debt risk has just been
shifted to the US. You see, the Fed has
already contacted the BOJ on concerns of
the weakness in the Japanese yen, and
this is enough for the market to do a
complete 180° turn. Japan does not want
a weak yen because this would limit the
central bank's ability to print money to
cap their bond yields, risking a
complete collapse of the currency, which
is really what should happen in this
situation. But here the US is also
showing that it does not want a weak
Japanese yen because a weak Japanese yen
means a strong dollar. And this goes
directly against the current
administration's strategy of trying to
weaken the exchange rate of the US
dollar to boost American manufacturing
and industry. So what you essentially
have is both central banks aligned on
which direction the Japanese yen should
be trading in. And that is that the yen
should be strengthening against the US
dollar. The reason this is so important
is because if both sides agree, the
reality is that they have the tools and
capabilities that are needed in order to
make it happen. The BOJ has a
significant capacity to sell its
extremely large US dollar reserves and
the Fed has an unlimited capacity to buy
the Japanese yen. These types of
synchronized exchange rate policies are
typically highly successful because they
are coordinated by the very institutions
that control the supply of the
currencies that are being manipulated.
No matter how much private investors
sell the Japanese yen, these two central
banks will be able to fill that void and
it is already working. Up until very
recently, the Japanese yen was the only
currency that was actually weakening
against the US dollar. as you can see
here from the US dollar measured against
various other currencies. But now with
the possibility of a coordinated policy
shift, the Japanese yen has made a 180°
turn with the US dollar losing 4% of its
purchasing power relative to the
Japanese yen. Now, more importantly,
take a look at what's happening with the
other currencies. This recent
development has also accelerated the
decline of the US dollar against other
currencies. The dollar is sinking more
rapidly against the euro, the Canadian
dollar, the Swedish crona, the Chinese
yuan. And this is absolutely key. It
means investors around the world are
perceiving this as a signal that the US
will do whatever it takes to limit the
US dollar strength against any currency,
even Japan that has significant debt
problem. This basically makes the US
dollar only as strong as the weakest
link. Now the question is how far can
the dollar actually sink as a result of
this? Well, according to the
International Bank of Settlements, the
US dollar has actually been extremely
overvalued over the last few years when
we adjust the exchange rates for local
inflation numbers. The Trump
administration's strategy is to break
the overvalued dollar to make American
goods and services more competitive and
kickstart the American economy. If they
get their way, it could open the door up
to as much as a 10 to 15% decline in the
US dollar index. Now, practically, what
does this mean for a portfolio? The
first consequence is that capital flows
away from the US dollar means that US
dollar denominated assets become less
attractive to hold. This is something
that's known as currency risk in
financial jargon. As an investor, it's
much wiser to be invested in assets that
are denominated in a strong currency.
So, a large weakening of the US dollar
could cause significant outflows from,
for example, the US stock market to
foreign markets. Now, that doesn't
necessarily mean that the stock market
will go down in dollar terms, but it
might mean that in euro terms, for
example, it does go down. This is why
we've been ramping up our foreign
exposure at Braavos Research. The second
more important consequence is that all
of this undermines fiat currencies in
general. Japan shows us what happens
when debt becomes unmanageable.
Institutions sacrifice the value of the
currency. And the reality is many other
nations are in very similar situations.
Japan was just early. So while we are
watching these shifts happening between
currencies, the bigger shift happening
is away from currencies in general.
We've seen this from the price of gold
and silver that have gone parabolic in
recent months, something that we called
what happened 2 years ago. But now we
think this is going to start spreading
to other areas of the commodities
market. This is something that I discuss
in detail in our investment strategy
report where we highlight the biggest
market opportunities of the year. You
