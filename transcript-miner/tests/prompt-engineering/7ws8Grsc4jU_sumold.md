## Summary
The global sovereign debt risk epicenter is shifting from Japan to the United States. Despite Japan's massive debt-to-GDP ratio and a collapsing bond market, a coordinated policy effort—reminiscent of the 1985 Plaza Accord—is emerging to prevent the Japanese Yen from weakening. This shift is reflected in the US Dollar Index (DXY) breaking its long-term uptrend. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to print money to cap skyrocketing bond yields, a move that typically devalues a currency, but US intervention aims to prevent a strong dollar, effectively absorbing Japan's currency risk.

## Key Points & Insights
- **Structural Trend Reversal**: The US dollar index is breaking a structural uptrend that has been in place since 2011.
- **Sovereign Debt Risk Shift**: Japan’s currency and debt risks are moving to the U.S. due to coordinated policy shifts between the Fed and the BOJ.
- **Bond Market Volatility**: Japanese 10-year, 30-year, and 40-year bond yields have surged to 20-year highs. The market volatility is being compared to the 2011 Greek debt crisis.
- **Monetary Policy Choice**: Japan faces two options for its debt: default/restructuring or money printing to cap yields. Evidence suggests they are choosing the latter ("sticking the middle finger up at anybody who holds Japanese bonds").
- **US Intervention**: The Fed has expressed concern over Yen weakness. A weak Yen creates a strong Dollar, which contradicts the current US administration's economic strategy.
- **Global Impact**: Japan’s $10.1 trillion debt is the world's largest relative to GDP, making it a primary "trigger for the destabilization of the global debt fabric."

## Numbers
- **$10.1 trillion**: Total Japanese debt pile (third largest in the world in USD terms).
- **20 years**: Highest levels reached by Japanese 10-year, 30-year, and 40-year bond yields.
- **2011**: The year the previous US dollar index structural uptrend began; also the year of the Greek debt crisis comparison.
- **1985**: The year of the Plaza Accord, used as a historical reference for current coordinated policy.

## Chances
- **Yield Capping**: High probability that the Bank of Japan will print money to buy government bonds to prevent yields from spiking further.
- **Currency Depreciation**: Typically a high chance for the Yen to weaken significantly during yield-capping, though US intervention is actively trying to mitigate this.

## Risks
- **Confidence Loss**: Bond investors are signaling a loss of confidence in Japanese bonds as a store of value.
- **Inflationary Pressure**: Significant tax breaks and the largest stimulus package since the pandemic are expected to widen the deficit and increase inflation.
- **Currency Collapse**: A risk that the Japanese Yen could experience a complete collapse if the central bank prints money without constraints.
- **US Contagion**: The intentional shifting of debt and currency risk from Japan to the US could destabilize US markets.

## Unknowns
- The specific details of the US administration's strategy that requires a weaker dollar.
- The exact scale of the BOJ's bond-buying program to cap yields.
- How the US economy will specifically absorb the "shifted" debt risk from Japan.
