## Summary
Jeremy Lefebvre reports on a significant morning sell-off in growth and tech stocks, describing it as a "bloodbath." Major holdings including Fubo and PayPal have seen double-digit percentage declines. Jeremy views these volatile periods as the "cost of doing business" for serious investors. Despite his public portfolio being down approximately $57,000 on the day, he deployed $70,000 into the market during the crash. He highlights Palantir's exceptionally strong earnings as a contrast to the prevailing negative market sentiment.

## Key Points & Insights
- **Market Volatility as Entry Point:** Jeremy spent $70,000 on stocks during the morning crash, emphasizing a contrarian approach to the "bloodbath."
- **Position Sizing and Diversity:** Essential for surviving days where specific holdings drop 20%+; Jeremy notes his account is down $57,000, which he considers "nothing" relative to his total position sizing.
- **Tech Sentiment:** Citing analyst Julian Emanuel, the mood around technology stocks is currently as cautious as it has been since the launch of ChatGPT.
- **Palantir Earnings:** Jeremy graded Palantir’s recent income statement as an "A++," the highest grade he has ever given, yet noted the stock was only up 6% despite the stellar performance.
- **Investor Psychology:** Stock market crashes and individual stock "crashes" are unavoidable milestones for reaching "big money." ("Sometimes your stocks are going to crash... Big deal. It's the cost of doing business.")
- **Bottom Fishing Debate:** The video examines different perspectives on "bottom fishing," with some analysts warning against the practice while Jeremy suggests current prices for stocks like PayPal may be attractive.

## Numbers
- **Fubo (FUBO):** Down 21%.
- **PayPal (PYPL):** Down 19%, trading at $42.22.
- **Shopify (SHOP):** Down 10%.
- **ServiceNow (NOW):** Down 7.5%.
- **Adobe (ADBE):** Down 7%.
- **Salesforce (CRM):** Down 7%.
- **Palantir (PLTR):** Up 6% following earnings.
- **Capital Outlay:** Jeremy spent $70,000 on purchases during the session.
- **Daily Loss:** Jeremy's public account decreased by $57,000.

## Chances
- **Fubo Recovery:** Jeremy questions if the 21% drop is an "overreaction" or an "it's over" situation.
- **PayPal Bottoming:** Mention of the current price ($42.22) potentially being a "good sign" for a bottom, despite the massive drop.

## Risks
- **Persistent Tech Caution:** The extremely cautious sentiment in tech could prevent stocks from being "rewarded" even for strong earnings.
- **Catching Falling Knives:** Referenced via the warning "Don't go bottom fishing for stocks."
- **Capital Loss:** Acknowledgment that even the best investors face losses of millions or billions of dollars.

## Unknowns
- The specific breakdown of the $70,000 purchase (which stocks and in what amounts).
- Whether Palantir will eventually be "rewarded" by the market for its "A++" quarter.
- The catalyst beyond earnings season for the broad-based 9:30 a.m. sell-off.
