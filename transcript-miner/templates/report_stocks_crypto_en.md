## 1) Stocks - Influencer Stock Radar

### 1.1 Coverage Map (quick)
- **Top themes/sectors** (e.g. AI, Solar, Smallcaps, Biotech ...)
- **Top tickers/companies** (with *how many influencers* + *recency*)
- **New / Re-rating / Drop**
  - New = mentioned for the first time
  - Re-rating = sentiment turns or thesis changes
  - Drop = frequent before, now gone

### 1.2 "Thesis Cards" per top stock (max 8-12)
For each stock:
- **Why bullish?** (3 bullet points, each: *who says it* + *why*)
- **Why bearish?** (3 bullet points)
- **Catalysts** (next 1-2 quarters + mid-term)
- **Kill switch (hard criteria)**: 2-3 measurable thresholds
  (e.g. revenue growth < X% for 2 quarters, margin falls > Y bp, cash runway < Z months)
- **Evidence links**: list of video IDs + short quotes (appendix)

### 1.3 Influencer overlay (favorite view)
- Per influencer:
  - **Top 5 picks / Top 5 avoids**
  - **Recurring patterns** (e.g. "likes high-growth, ignores valuation")
  - **Track record note** (optional later: hit rate/revisions)

## 2) Macro - Outlook & scenarios

### 2.1 One-pager: "What is their base case?"
- **Base case (60%)**: 5 bullet points
- **Bull case (20%) / Bear case (20%)**: 3-5 bullet points each
- **Which data decide?** (e.g. CPI/PCE, labor market, ISM/PMI, yield curve, credit spreads)

### 2.2 Disagreement map
- Where do they agree?
- Where do they contradict each other?
- What are the **decisive assumptions** behind the difference?

### 2.3 Market implications (translated into action)
- What does it mean for:
  - **Equities** (growth vs value, small vs large)
  - **Rates** (duration)
  - **USD/commodities**
  - **Risk-on / Risk-off**
In practice: 3-5 clear "if-then" sentences.

## 3) Crypto - Narratives, trades, risks

### 3.1 Narrative snapshot
- Main narratives (e.g. "L2s", "AI tokens", "Restaking", "RWA")
- "What is new" vs "running for months"

### 3.2 Coin/Project cards (top 8-12)
For each coin/project:
- **Thesis** (utility, adoption, moat, token mechanics only if relevant)
- **Catalyst calendar** (upgrades, unlocks, listings, reg events)
- **Risks** (dilution/unlocks, governance, security, regulatory)
- **On-chain/market checks (minimal)**: 2-3 metrics, if available

### 3.3 Macro link (crypto as risk asset)
